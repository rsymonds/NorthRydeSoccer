                On such a fantastic day we knew we were in for some fantastic soccer and we were
                not disappointed. Our boys today put in a great effort despite the grass being
                more like a slippery ice rink than a grass oval - there was many spills and
                slides but it only added to the fun the boys were having out there.&nbsp;
                <img class="middle noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_smiling.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                We had some great runs from Hayden and some fabulous footwork from Jack and a
                lot of support from Felix when it was needed, but today this game was all North
                Ryde. Our goal kickers Nic, Cooper and Jayden did a fantastic job kicking the
                ball thru the net 6 times over the whole game, the poor Macquarie Dragons didn't
                stand a chance today.
                <br/><br/>
                Another lot of great team work was on display and I think this little team of
                Under 6's is one to look out for in the future.
                <br/><br/>
                Man of the match (although there were many) went to Cooper today, so well done
                Cooper, and well done boys, it was a pleasure to watch.&nbsp;

                Whether it was the early morning start or the hangover from their win last start,
                the team didn't seem to get out of first gear this week.
                <br/><br/>
                Everyone tried hard again and Christian scored his obligatory couple of goals.
                Blake's tenacity in defence kept the score from blowing out and earned him the
                Player of the Week award.&nbsp;

                On the 19th of June North Ryde were playing against Ryde Saints United at our
                home ground. Saints United were coming last on the ladder but they only lost
                2 - 0 to West Pennant Hills (the top team) so we did not know what we were up
                against.
                <br/><br/>
                North Ryde won the toss and decided to pick the half, leaving Saints United
                with the kick-off. As the game was about to start, everyone found their positions
                and got ready. Then the whistle blew. There were a few rough tackles from Saints
                United but North Ryde fought back hard. Eli set up a great though ball to Adam
                who ran with the ball and kicked it into the goal. The score was 1 - 0 to North
                Ryde. A few minutes later Adam took a corner which Shannon managed to get to and
                header straight into the goal. That gave North Ryde a 2 - 0 lead. At the end of
                the first half Shannon once again dribbled through a few defenders and had a shot
                at goal and it went in. North Ryde were up 3 - 0 by the time the whistle blew for
                half time.&nbsp;

                There had been some brilliant defending by Jack, Tim, Christopher, Tom H and
                Patrick, excellent passing and through balls from Tom M, David, Eli and Oscar,
                magnificent finishing off by Adam and Shannon, and great goal-keeping by Tim
                and Jett.
                <br/><br/>
                When the whistle blew for the second half, it was North Ryde's turn to kick off.
                Saints United came back strong and North Ryde had to work hard to keep the lead.
                David dribbled the ball and passed it to Tom M who finished it off to take the
                score to 4 - 0. But Saints United did not give up and they took a shot that Jett
                could just not reach and it managed to go into the goal. That made the score
                4 - 1. Soon afterwards Adam scored another goal by kicking the ball with his left
                foot into the top of the net. That made the score 5 - 1 to North Ryde.&nbsp;

                <br/><br/>
                There were only a few minutes left until the end of the game. By that time there
                were a few more people joining the crowd on the sideline because of the next game.
                The final whistle blew and North Ryde had a 5 - 1 victory. Eli got the Player of
                the Match for doing excellent passing and running with the ball.

                The day started wonderfully. It was sunny and warm and we had all of the teams'
                15 players present. At kickoff, we immediately went on the attack with Anthony
                moving the ball into enemy territory. A throw in by Thomas and big boot from
                Harry saw us challenging the Redbacks deep into their half in the early stages
                of the game.
                <br/><br/>
                We were looking strong and certain to score when one of the Redbacks fastest
                players managed an intercept and incredibly was able to take the ball the length
                of the field and to our goal where with only daylight between him and our goalie,
                was able to successfully shoot a goal 8 min into the first half. We immediately
                found ourselves defending a relentless attack by the opposition with two shots
                at our goal denied by Peter our goalie and strong defence by Andrhea.&nbsp;

                We countered by moving the play back into the Redbacks half with a shot at goal
                by Lachlan denied by their keeper. A great team effort set up by Harry, deflection
                by Lachlan and shot by Lawrence saw us score our first goal 21 minutes into the
                first half, making the score 1-1 where it remained for the rest of that half.&nbsp;

                A strong defence foiled initial attempts at our goal early in the second half,
                however the opposition could taste a goal and repeated attacks saw them score 3
                min into the second half. It was time to get tough with Harry taking the ball deep
                into the Redbacks half with an attempt at their goal stopped by their keeper.
                Saxon and Sam made a great effort to advance the ball, only to see the opposition
                move it back into our half and a shot at our goal denied by strong defence by
                Matthew. An immediate follow up shot saw Peter dive to stop the goal.&nbsp;
                <img class="middle noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_smiling.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                A fresh set of substitutes saw strong play by Jack attacking the opposition defence
                and bringing the play to their goal area. Some broken play saw the ball move up and
                down the field with a goal attempt eventually being made by the opposition, only to
                be stopped once again by our goalie. Harry immediately countered by taking the ball
                all the way to the opposition goal, however strong defence by them saw him shoot
                wide. Unfortunately the Redbacks' goalie was injured during the attempt and had to
                be retired from the game. Another goal by the Redbacks at the 22 minute mark made
                the score 3-1 to them where it remained for the rest of the game.
                <br/><br/>
                It was not a bad effort by our team with some of the great attacking we made, not
                converted into goals.

                A great result for the boys that's catapulted the team into the top 4 for the
                first time this season!!&nbsp;
                <img class="bottom noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_smiling.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                To everyone's credit, this result reflects continued effort at training; the
                growing cohesion of the team; and the continued support of the Club through the
                willingness of other players (and their parents) to help make up team numbers.
                <br/><br/>
                Last weekend's result saw a tremendous team effort with some notable individual
                efforts. This included Andrew and Will bagging their first goals for the season.
                Andrew's came from an incisive run into the box matched with a clinical finish.
                Keep that up Andrew! Will slotted a penalty that would make any Socceroos proud
                expertly looping the ball over the keepers head and into the back of the net.&nbsp;

                <br/><br/>
                The third goal came from Nick stepping up from the 11s.  Whilst these were
                goal-scoring highlights, Jackson was the deserving player of the week who ran
                himself into the ground providing a strong presence in central mid. Special
                thanks go to Declan and Fred also from the 11s who lent a hand, Declan notably
                making some great saves in goal in the second half.

                Sorry to take so long to get this report done, especially since it is a report
                about a game in which the team put up probably their best performance of the
                year. The  scoreline of 2 to nil does not reflect the efforts of the boys and
                the quality of the performance on the day.
                <br/><br/>
                A big thank you to Josh Hallam who came along to take on the coaching role for
                the day. Once again the bounce of the ball and at least one off-side refereeing
                decision cost us a goal and a possible win. Sam B once again kept goals soundly
                and saved a penalty on the day. Well done Sam.&nbsp;

                Kenny R and James H played well up front and continually worried the Thornleigh
                defence. One cracking shot from James still has the goal post vibrating from
                when it cannoned into the cross bar, so close yet so far.
                <br/><br/>
                There were many positives to take from this game, strong defence, probing
                questioning attacking play with some nice interpassing starting to develop, but
                most pleasingly was the solid team effort from everyone involved and the positive
                spirit in which you played the game and encouraged and supported each other. Keep
                it up with another strong training run under your belts the win will come this
                week if you can show the same level of commitment as last week.&nbsp;
