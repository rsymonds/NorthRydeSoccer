                Second week in & our under 6's kicked off with an early game at Magdala Road. Right
                from the start you could see the confidence in these boys this week, it was really
                amazing to watch.
                <br/><br/>
                All the boys were trying equally as hard as the other & it didn't take long to get
                our 1st goal in, followed by 4 more over the whole game, thanks to our goal kickers
                Nic, Hayden & Jack.&nbsp;
                <img class="middle noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_smiling.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                These goals were set up well with the help of a few breaks from the pack by Jayden
                & a wonderful run up the field dribbling the ball the whole way by Cooper. Cooper
                also hit the ground many a time by some serious collisions, you'd almost think it
                was rugby we were watching, but he never failed to get back up on his feet & carry
                on & this attitude to the game helped him earn Man of the Match, so well done Cooper,
                keep up the good work.&nbsp;
                <img class="middle noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_thumbs_up.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                It was really great to see the boys already playing off each other, passing the ball
                & defending the goals when the time came for that. It is becoming obvious that for
                most of them standing sideline for the last few years watching big brothers play has
                really helped with their knowledge of the game so early into their first year.
                <br/><br/>
                Well done boys, keep up the fantastic work.

                Our second outing for the season saw a tightly fought and entertaining match with
                both teams playing with Great Spirit. Luke's passing & Lachlan's defending was
                outstanding.&nbsp;

                Jasmine and Luka tackled and won the ball with gusto whilst Brandon's and Ryan's
                enthusiasm inspired the team and finally our player of the week Jayden's never-die
                attitude with great support from the sidelines pulled the team together for an
                amazing all round team performance.&nbsp;

                This week's game was at a familiar setting for many of the team from last year, who
                completed pre-season practise at Santa Rosa Park. Feeling very comfortable, our team
                had a great start to the game with Bailey, Will and Jayden showing extreme keenness
                to get in and tackle for the ball. Wonderful attacking moves from Archie and Alex
                sent the ball along the sidelines at great speeds.&nbsp;
                <img class="middle noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_smiling.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                We had a number of fantastic goal shooting attempts with Archie surprising himself
                to score first for the team. Cameron took a wonderful intercept and in a very
                controlled manner edged the ball very close to the goal but alas missed by the
                <img class="noborder imgleft" src="images/photos/u6/20100424_u6_reda_2.jpg">
                smallest of margins. Only a short while later, being the trooper that he is Cameron
                got straight back into play and collectively the team assisted to ensure another
                goal was scored, although there was some confusion for a moment until it was
                established it was made by Archie's foot.&nbsp;
                <img class="middle noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_confused.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                The team were really chasing the ball hard this week. Lucas early in the second half
                took a fantastic intercept and weaved the ball to the goal even managing to kick it
                high into the air before it falling into the back of the net. Jayden was extremely
                brave taking two excellent blocks to the body and continuing to play on. Alex scored
                another impressive goal for the team and was ably supported by Bailey who showed
                enthusiastic play in the middle of the field.
                <br/><br/>
                Our supporters were very excited throughout the match this week and loved every
                minute of it. Even when we were heading in the wrong direction momentarily... they
                were also very impressed by the hand signals by ALL the boys at throw-ins!
                <br/><br/>
                Player of the week was a close decision but Cameron received the award very proudly
                for his monster effort at goal attempts this week.&nbsp;

                It was another beautiful day at Magdala Park. Both teams were well supported by

                <br/><br/>
                The game was hard fought. The commitment from both teams was outstanding, and

                The opposition team were younger and more inexperienced, some of their players

                Well deserving of the "Player of the Week" trophy was Maxwell Wilmot. Max scored
                his first two goals of the year, and was one of the stand out performers! Well
                done Max!!&nbsp;

                So the U7 Greens season has begun! A 3 - 3 draw last week followed by a 3 - 1 win
                this week and its been a whirlwind of tackles, fast feet, finding space and zigging
                and zagging. Although some of this was done without the ball, and some of the boys
                did seem intent on inventing a new sport during breaks in the game which seemed
                like a cross between Soccer, WWF and the Haka, the skill levels and concentration
                are definitely on the up.
                <br/><br/>
                Last week the call was "Tackles" with Thomas "The Rock" Bain winning man of the
                match for some superb last ditch tackling. This week the call was for "Fast Feet"
                and, my word, did we have some fast feet on the pitch! It was like the Riverdance
                out there!&nbsp;
                <img class="middle noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_smiling.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                Finn was really fired up after one of the opposition called him a girl before the
                game, and just missed out on a couple of goals; Annirudh made some great blocks and
                some telling passes which were so good he would then stand back and study them for
                a minute or two just to let it sink in how good they really were.
                <br/><br/>
                Will was popping up everywhere on the pitch like a great big mad pop-up thing while
                Thomas was tackling like a crazy again. As for Evan - what can you say? Birthday boy
                was unreal with his saving tackles and bringing the ball out of defence!
                <br/><br/>
                However for scoring a hat trick and using his face to stop a certain goal, the Man
                of the Match had to go to Michael Flatley, sorry, Hamish Saba.&nbsp;

                It was a beautiful warm autumn day. The players were gathered and the air was full
                of nervous energy. The whistle blew and they were off. All our players were here
                for the match.

                North Ryde White A team started well and dominated for the first half with three

                During the game we saw some great attacking from Ibrahim and Isaak. We saw some
                strong defending from Dominic and Leonardo.
                <br/><br/>
                Some great assisting was done by Emma, Jake and Sam. The best dribbling was done
                by Ibrahim. The best passing was done by Sam and the most amazing goal save was
                done by Isaak.&nbsp;

                The team had a great start to the match and although All Saints were a few goals

                Our 2nd week saw us kick off at West Epping Oval, with one man down & one of our team
                players not feeling well, we knew our boys would have to work hard with no reserves to
                fall back on.
                <br/><br/>
                We started with Blake in Goals but it wasn't long before our sick boy Jay showed he
                really wasn't well enough to run around, so we put him in goals for the whole game &
                it was amazing as the rest of the team kept the ball down the other end nearly the
                whole game, so that worked in Jay's favour.&nbsp;
                <img class="middle noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_smiling.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                The boys' defence was unbelievable, even though we watched the other team's players
                swap every so often for a break & then send on a new fresh player, our boys held
                strong, so well done boys.
                <br/><br/>
                Our 1st goal came from Aden, a very exciting moment, then the Redbacks also scored
                to make it 1 - 1 at half time.
                <br/><br/>
                Luke A's & Jarrod's fancy footwork really is outstanding to watch & the way Luke M
                just comes from nowhere to get to the ball everytime is incredible. Blake's
                determination is always a pleasure to watch, especially once the other team scored
                another goal we knew we didn't have long to at least make it even.
                <br/><br/>
                Our boys came thru with a fantastic last goal for the game, they pulled together &
                in a great sprint for the ball Nathaniel made the most amazing kick for goals, the
                ball flew up over everyones heads & went straight in. There was a huge roar from the
                sideline as it was just in time to bring us up to 2-all, so well done Nathaniel.&nbsp;
                <img class="middle noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_thumbs_up.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                The 1st 2 weeks have truly been a pleasure to watch, the boys are working wonderfully
                together, they know each of their team mate's skills & strengths & are really playing
                off each other, and not trying to do it all on their own.
                <br/><br/>
                Great team spirit & obviously great fitness too which was shown this week. Man of the
                match went to Jay to say thanks for sticking with us even though you were not feeling
                your best, so well done Jay.&nbsp;

                The U9 Div 1's were up against Epping Eastwood on Saturday morning, a team who was
                new in the division and a relatively unknown quantity. But I don't think many under
                10's care too much about the form and history of their opposition. It's more a case
                of: "The whistle has blown, there's a ball on the pitch, game on!"&nbsp;
                <img class="middle noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_smiling.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                The game started off at a fair enough pace as both teams stretched their legs about
                the park, hunting for opportunities. And it wasn't long before they came, with
                Shannon and Patrick scoring in relatively quick succession within the first ten
                minutes of the match.

                Epping Eastwood were awarded a penalty just outside the box towards the end of the
                first half and made no mistake by slotting it high between the top post and Tim's
                outstretched hands.

                The score remained 2 - 1 in North Ryde's favour until the half-way mark. The contest
                had been fairly even but you could sense that North Ryde were winding themselves up
                for bigger and better things. Bigger and better is exactly what they got, and the
                whistle at the start of the second half marked the beginning
                <br/><br/>

                of a merciless rort that saw North Ryde rip through the heart of the opposition,
                leaving carnage and six unanswered goals in their wake. It was a beautiful thing
                to watch, and arguably their finest 25 minutes of focused game-play and teamwork
                to date.&nbsp;

                <br/><br/>
                In this mood, there was little that Epping Eastwood could do to stop the devastation
                as North Ryde moved the ball around the park with skill and determination.
                Opportunities were created with superb passing and footwork from one side of the
                field to the other, and taken
                <br/><br/>

                advantage of as soon as the ball entered the danger zone. Goals came thick and
                fast, and at regular intervals off the boots of Shannon, Adam, Jack, Jett and
                Tom M, taking the final and full-time tally to 8 - 1.
                <br/><br/>
                A great performance from a team who give it their all from the first to the last,
                and who are showing a lot of maturity on the field with sensible and effective
                sequences of play that ultimately reflects positively on the scoreboard.
                <br/><br/>
                And
                despite the skill and fitness they demonstrate to us each Saturday morning, they
                are still just young boys who enjoy having a lot of fun together, and do it with
                so much energy that they make all of us watching from the sideline wish we were
                young again.&nbsp;

                Saturday morning was heralded by the blaring of alarm clocks as the U10/4 had the
                early game. Luckily we only had a short trek to Epping and we were able to get the
                game finished prior to the real heat of the day.
                <br/><br/>

                This week also saw us field a full complement of players so were able to use our
                interchanges to maximum benefit - this is particularly important as the team still
                adapts to playing on the big field. The team started off a little tentatively but
                were soon able to find their rhythm and were applying tremendous pressure on the
                opposing side.
                <br/><br/>
                Some excellent support work and crisp passing from the mid-field through to the
                forwards saw North Ryde take an early 1 - 0 lead thanks to a great effort by Jack.
                With the first goal under our belts, things really started to open up and before
                we knew it 3 more goals were in - another one to Jack and two super toe-pokes by
                our forward, Lachlan and defender, Thomas. Epping Eastwood were able to make a few
                fast breaks but tenacious defending by Andrhea, Harrison and Jordan, and pressure
                saves by our goalkeeper Alvin saw us go to the break 4 - 0 up.&nbsp;
                <img class="middle noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_smiling.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                The second half was tighter with stronger defending from Epping Eastwood and a
                couple of unlucky misses by Laurence and Peter. The team learnt a valuable lesson
                about 'playing to the whistle' when a ball that looked like it went out on our goal
                line was 'hand-balled' as we attempted a goal kick restart. The referee had not
                indicated that the ball was out. Epping Eastwood was able to convert the penalty
                kick, despite a great effort by Alvin.
                <br/><br/>
                The win was sealed with another goal to Jack - a hat-trick for the day.&nbsp;
                <img class="bottom noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_thumbs_up.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                Overall, a great effort by the team in notching their first win for the season and
                in such emphatic style.

                scored a lucky goal against the run of play to win 3-2. Our team played like a
                champion team as usual, they worked together, passed the ball to each other, made
                some fantastic line breaks,and defended well.

                Everyone gave 100% and it was a fantastic game of soccer to watch. You should be

                A tough day at the office for the 12/6's after negotiating the long haul to Kenthurst.
                <br/><br/>
                Despite only having 10 lads, the 12/6's put on a brave display taking up the challenge
                of Kenthurst and really the end score was more a reflection of tired legs in the second
                half than any lack of commitment as the teams were pretty evenly matched for the better
                part of the game.
                <br/><br/>
                North Ryde were unlucky to go into half time 1-0 down after a number of shots on goal
                failed to yield a result. After a drink and time to catch their breath, the lads came
                out in the second half firing and Joel bagged a great equaliser 5 minutes into the
                second half.&nbsp;
                <img class="middle noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_smiling.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                Despite this, the lift in spirits was short lived as Kenthurst, aided by an army of
                reserves, then went about putting 4 goals away in quick succession. There are clear
                signs that the team is starting to click with some good combinations starting to
                appear.
                <br/><br/>
                Jackson, aided by Dom in the second half worked well up front. The backs led by Lucas
                in centre and Kevin and Karan showed real commitment in closing down opposition raids.
                And the halves comprising Connor, Alex and Andrew are emerging as committed players
                willing to have a go in both attack and defence.
                <br/><br/>
                The stand out performance for the day was Will who played as a defensive midfielder
                expertly filling the space between the backs and midfielders. Will chased down
                everything that came near him and was a deserving player of the week.&nbsp;

                found out by through balls and the opposition's superior pace out wide.

                To their immense credit the team rallied in the second half following a challenging
