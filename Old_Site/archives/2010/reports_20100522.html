                It was a wet but glorious victory, 15-1 for the White A's!

                Ollie did a fantastic job running with the ball and did some great big kicks in
                order to win the Man of the Match!&nbsp;

                Ben was fantastic in defence and stopped many goals from being scored and Ryan
                scored a fantastic goal which he dribbled halfway down the field and scored with
                great excitement. Max, Toby and Ashton were on a goal scoring fest and used what
                they had practised at training to dribble and pass beautifully. Well done in
                harsh conditions!&nbsp;

                A wet & miserable Saturday morning did not provide ideal conditions for
                scintillating game play by the White B's this week. However, it did not dampen
                the enthusiasm shown by the team on the field, as they piled on the pressure to
                their more experienced opponents.
                <br/><br/>
                <img class="noborder imgtopleft" src="images/photos/u6/20100522_u6_whiteb_2.jpg">
                Christian again scored an early goal which brought his season tally to 3, and set
                the scene for a close contest. Alexis attacked the ball well, and was unlucky not
                to score.&nbsp;
                <img class="middle noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_smiling.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                Blake made a few good runs with the ball, with one particular drive through the
                middle of the defence a standout. Riley continued to get into the thick of it by
                chasing anything that moved, while Joshua was never far away from the action.
                <br/><br/>
                Idan had his best game of the season, putting in an extra effort to win the
                contest for the ball and was rewarded with his first goal and the Player of
                the Week award.&nbsp;
                <img class="middle noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_thumbs_up.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                Again, a big improvement by all players was evident which only bodes well for
                coming matches.

                Fontenoy Field #3 was wet and slippery after the night's rain and the turf was wet
                underfoot. Everybody at North Ryde played well and had to lift their game to match
                the skills of their mighty Dragon opponents.
                <br/><br/>
                Within seconds of starting, the Dragons came at us hard and kicked an early goal.
                1-0 Dragons. North Ryde quickly replied and off the boot of Finn, it was even, 1-1.
                For the rest of the first half, everybody marked well, spread the ball wide and
                <img class="noborder imgleft" src="images/photos/u7/20100522_u7_green_2.jpg">
                played as a team. Hamish had some good clearances from the back, whilst Finn worked
                tirelessly on the attack with a number of near goal attempts just missing the
                posts.&nbsp;
                <img class="middle noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_thumbs_up.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                At half time, coach for the day, Darren re-iterated that the day was all about
                'teamwork' and shortly thereafter, everybody was back on the pitch for the second
                half, rested and rearing to go.
                <br/><br/>
                The second half was again very tough with everybody trying hard. Anniruddh made
                some good tackles in midfield and Will & Tom were solid in their defence of the
                superb Dragons attack, often putting their bodies on the line (sometimes I mean
                literally on the ground) in order to make the tackle.&nbsp;
                <img class="middle noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_smiling.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                With about 5 minutes to go, the Dragons slotted their second goal for the game,
                another from long range. 2-1 Dragons. Evan, man of the match, quickly replied with
                a goal for North Ryde. The score was now even at 2-2. Almost immediately, from a
                goal kick, the Dragons kicked the ball to their star player who raced away down
                their left-hand side to score, single handed. 3-2 Dragons. Just when everybody
                thought the final whistle was about to be blown, the Dragons scored again, another
                long range shot! 4-2 Dragons.
                <br/><br/>
                North Ryde used great spirit to move forward onto attack and put intense pressure
                on the Dragons defence. Following a scrum and a scuffle in the Dragons goal mouth,
                the Dragons kicked an own-goal just as the final whistle blew.
                <br/><br/>
                What a great game!

                What a great game. Each week seems to be improvements all round with out Mighty
                Bees. Holy Cross had a couple of players home sick with this cold weather and
                therefore had no reserves this week. A few members of our team were battling off
                a cough and cold and we hope that they feel better soon. John Eadie (our coach
                this week) started the pre-game warm up with some shots on goal and everone was
                excited to take the field.
                <br/><br/>
                In the first 20 mintutes the ball was sailing from one end of the field to the other
                like a game of ping pong. There was nothing between these 2 great teams. The fact
                that a lot of both teams were friends through school and living locally made for
                <img class="noborder imgleft" src="images/photos/u7/20100522_u7_whiteb_2.jpg">
                a fun, competitive and supportive game of soccer. With such a fast paced game,
                both sides were feeling tired and just before half time, HCC broke through an
                outstanding North Ryde defence to score.
                <br/><br/>
                The midfield was very strong this week. Special mention goes to Rishi - his defence
                and attack was outstanding. When everyone was tired he kept soldiering on and made
                some amazing slide tackles that surely saved a number of shots on goal, a true
                display of skill for the full game.&nbsp;

                <br/><br/>
                Cameron was reading the play well in the sweeper position and was kicking those
                balls left and right to his team mates - well done. Luca and Liam were also great
                in the midfield and attacking well. Emily and Kevin made some great runs down the
                field showing their ball skills through the HCC defence. The big moment came for
                Oliver this week, his first goal of the season dribbling a fine goal over the line
                and what axcitement it brought as the sideline erupted to the equalizer 10 minutes
                into the second half.&nbsp;

                From that moment both teams continued to play their best until the final whistle
                blew. The result a 1-1 draw. Thanks John for coaching the team and refereeing, we
                all appreciate it.

                The boys... Luke A, Jarrod, Jay, Nathaniel, Kaiden, Aden and Blake worked really
                hard at this week's game, showing an excellent demonstration of team thinking
                skills and great ball skills leading them to a few close calls. Luke M would
                love to have seen the tricky ball skills.
                <br/><br/>
                Hungry for a goal, just before end of the first half the boys worked well managing
                to get the ball across to Aden who positioned himself well to put one between the
                posts... Yahooooo, well deserved!&nbsp;

                The U10 Div 1 juggernaut that had burst into the 2010 season with five straight
                wins was finally halted in it's tracks by an impressive display of football by
                the Gladesville Ravens team, who took us to task on just about every aspect of
                the game on all corners of the Peel Park football pitch.
                <br/><br/>
                The Ravens came out firing as soon as the whistle blew and set up camp in our
                half for the first ten minutes of the game. They were a well-drilled and
                well-organised team that stuck to the basics of the game, and barring any
                catastrophic meltdown or fatigue on their part you could sense that our North
                Ryde boys were going to be up against it for much of the match. Our defence was
                put to the test as the Ravens sent wave after wave of attack towards our goal
                line. Tom M was the stand-out workhorse during these exchanges, using speed and
                strength to repel the attacks and keep the scoreline on an even keel, and Tim
                the Keeper made a sterling effort to keep the ball out of the goals with some
                magnificent saves.&nbsp;
                <img class="middle noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_thumbs_up.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                Once the dust had settled a bit, North Ryde did start to string together a few
                runs that saw them enter the Raven's goal mouth and look for scoring opportunities.
                On one occasion David managed to chip the ball over the defence and keeper into
                the back of the net, only to have it disallowed due to an earlier handball
                infringement. Ravens pressed on, and with just seconds of the first half remaining
                they scored the first goal of the match which, to their credit, was an absolute
                humdinger. A cross had been made from the deep left to the outside centre of the
                North Ryde box, and was struck with a force and conviction into the back of our net
                that neither man nor beast could have stopped.
                <br/><br/>
                The tempo in the second half was much the same as it had been in the first, and
                North Ryde continued to play on the back foot. We were losing most of our one-on-one
                encounters and the Raven's rock-solid line of defence ensured that any breaks we made
                were easily intercepted or met with a massive kick downfield. Our defence was
                continuously under pressure and the Raven's second goal came from a pin-point corner
                that was neatly headed into our goals.
                <br/><br/>
                North Ryde was awarded a penalty midway through the second half following an
                infringement outside the Raven's box, and Adam clawed back one goal for the team with
                a high and well-placed strike that sailed over everyone's heads into the back of the
                net. Ravens struck back just moments afterwards though with a carbon-copy of their
                second goal; a guided corner-kick that parachuted into the North Ryde goal mouth and
                was headed in behind the line.
                <br/><br/>
                North Ryde plugged on though, despite the chips being down, and kept on trying to
                find a pathway through the black- and white-striped shirts. With just a few minutes
                of the match remaining Jett found some space on the right wing and used his speed
                and strength to power his way down the field and launch a solo attack on the goals.
                It was a great effort, and his eventual strike just missed the left post by a few
                centimetres.
                <br/><br/>
                The final score was a deserving 3 - 1 win to the Ravens. Their team was well
                structured and had no noticible weak links on the field, making it very difficult
                for our team to mount any serious threats on their goals and reducing us to pot-luck
                opportunities. There were plenty of lessons for our team to take on board after
                this match, not least of which is teamwork itself, but the loss will at least shake
                off any signs of complacency and help them bounce back in future games, fortified
                with the knowledge that they are not invincible and can use their combined strengths
                to, well, reach their goals.&nbsp;

                We were at home this week to yet another strong team in the competition. The weather
                was damp but the mood was good after last week holding the competition leaders to a
                narrow 1-0 loss. In the first half the team was made up of 3 under 10 div 5 boys as
                we were short on numbers this week. A special thanks to Thomas, Ben and Pranav for
                playing the first half as they had yet to play in their own game.&nbsp;

                We have now played the top two teams in the last 2 weeks and only conceded 3 goals
                which is a very good effort considering how many goals that both of these teams have
                scored so far. It has been a really good defensive effort from all the team and we
                are starting to value our goals and defend with great urgency. It was 0-0 at half
                time and this was due to all the boys playing some great soccer from the backs and
                through the midfield. Our forwards had a few chances to score and it was a very even
                first half.&nbsp;
                <img class="middle noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_thumbs_up.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                In the second half we had no substitutes, which may have made the difference as our
                boys seemed to be run off their feet. We still had a few more chances to score but
                the end result was a 2 - nil loss.
                <br/><br/>
                It is now half way in the season and it is round 2 from this weekend. A chance now
                to beat those teams that beat us in the first round. We have proven that our team
                can match it with those teams on top of the ladder so lets all look forward to the
                second half of the season and try and push for the final 4 teams. With our shoe
                laces tied up tight and the thought of making the top 4 I am sure we will see some
                more great football from our under 10/4s.

                This week the boys were up against the Gladesville Ravens. There had been a lot of
                overnight rain and some drizzle in the morning. However, it looked like it was
                going to turn into a nice day. The boys started to roll up. It looked like our
                boys had a challenge on their hands. But there was 30 minutes before kick off.
                The coach had the boys doing some warm-up drills before the kickoff. With the
                opposition coach warming up the well-oiled Raven machine there was no fear present
                on the boys faces as the coach was encouraging the boys to have fun and enjoy
                themselves.
                <br/><br/>
                The Ravens won the toss and chose to kick off. Our boys started strong and kept the
                ball away from our goals early with some close attempts on their goals by Massie
                and Adam and a nice run from Ethan. Ben was goalie for the first half and managed
                to save a few with some strong clearing kicks from Josh, Salim and Ahmed, with great
                midfield play by Timothy, Makoto and Pranav. The coach interchanged Thomas, Julian
                and Sebastiano through the first half. It was great to see them burst forward and
                the defensive play by all the boys. To see the boys take in the training and put it
                on the field on game day was fantastic. The boys had an exceptional half with no
                goals by either side.
                <br/><br/>
                With encouragement from the coach at half time the boys took off from where they
                left off from the first half. Without some great defensive play the Raven's could
                have been in front by 3 goals. However our boys weren't giving up. It was the first
                game that Julian (Birthday boy) has played as striker. With the key element that
                the boys had practiced at training fresh in his mind - when in the penalty area
                take a shot - and with 15 seconds left on the clock the ball left Julian's boot
                and went high in the left hand corner of the net. As the ball hit the back of the
                net the ref called the full time whistle. The jubilation on the boys faces as they
                won their first game was fantastic.&nbsp;
                <img class="middle noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_thumbs_up.gif">
                <br/>
                The U10/5's played very well and deserved the win. I will be looking forward to
                next week's game. I dare say the picture explains it all!&nbsp;

                North Ryde's finest assembled this week at the 1st class facilities of North Ryde
                Oval, on a cool blustery Saturday afternoon. Our heroes were pumped for a good
                performance today, coming off a lacklustre performance the previous week which
                ended in a loss and had one of their players up in front of the judiciary because
                he chose to carry a handbag. This week's assignment had them up against Holy Cross,
                a foe our heroes have clashed with many a time over the years, with some of their
                grand final clashes still being whispered about throughout hushed changerooms
                across this vast continent. Our heroes had trouble looking in the eyes of their
                comrades, so deep was the shame from their feminine performance the previous week,
                and the boys nervously anticipated the fire and brimstone sermon that Crusher was
                undoubtedly about to unleash upon them.
                <br/><br/>
                Brother Mick sauntered over to the tense men, climbed atop of his inflatable pulpit,
                and with hands clenched on the good book, he gazed down upon these blue and gold
                warriors gathered in front of him... the men fell silent... the capacity crowd
                hushed... time, stood still... Crush inhaled a deep breath and stared into the souls
                of his crusaders... The silence was deafening... For 5 whole minutes North Ryde's
                finest stood in that roaring silence, they had unconsciously huddled together
                shoulder to shoulder, their breathing had synchronized, their hearts beating as one
                as it crashed throughout their ears. The referee blew a long piercing whistle
                signalling the start of the game, and still our heroes stood silently fast... and as
                the pea stopped vibrating around inside its metal prison, Crush raised his stubbled
                chin and muttered... "Enough said". A blood curdling roar shattered the silence as
                our heroes couldn't contain their emotions any longer, they bolted at the field and
                hurdled the fence into the fray, like their forefathers in Turkey all those years
                ago...
                <br/><br/>
                The game started at a ferocious pace, with North Ryde's finest dominating play with
                so many shots ringing off the crossbar it sounded like a Sunday in the city of
                churches... Proving themselves to be a gallant opposition, Holy Cross struck back,
                and counterpunched our heroes, going toe to toe for the next 15 minutes without
                either side being able to trouble the scorers. The rest of the first half proved to
                be a war of attrition, with both sides throwing fresh troops into the melee trying
                without success to gain the upper hand. Both teams wearily jogged to the sheds at
                half time, bloodied and bruised, nil - all was a good reflection of that half and
                it was evident to all that the victory in this clash will be awarded to the team
                that purely wants it more.
                <br/><br/>
                Our heroes took their positions for the commencement of the second half, the stiff
                southerly breeze was now at their backs and a smirk tugged at the corners of their
                mouths because this was what these men where bred for, a battle of wills against a
                determined and uncompromising enemy. The lone match official started the second half,
                and immediately the game was thrown back into the same trench warfare we witnessed
                earlier, with neither team giving an inch as they tussled for supremacy in this epic
                battle. The fierce determination shown by North Ryde's finest was beginning to pay
                dividends, as the blue and gold warriors began to assert their authority apon their
                foes, and should have been rewarded with a penalty when after a brilliant attack we
                witnessed "Lukey" being savagely brought down in the box. This only galvanised our
                heroes, and again they attacked, and they were rewarded at the 58th minute with a
                free kick deep inside enemy territory... the ball sailed purposely towards the goals,
                but the keeper was well positioned for an easy take... when suddenly darkness fell
                across the goalbox,the sun was momentarily blacked out as Crusher, who ran from
                sweeper, soared well above the pack to deflect the ball off his sweaty brow, passed
                the stunned keeper into the back of the net.&nbsp;

                <br/><br/>
                North Ryde's finest could now smell blood in the water, and attacked Holy Cross with
                such vigour that there coach was seen kneeling in prayer for his team... another
                vicious tackle inside the box saw the referee point to the spot, and in the 64th
                minute our heroes from the courtesy of Aussie Dan's well placed penalty extended
                their lead to 2 - nil.
                <br/><br/>
                The water was now bright red,the vultures began circling, Holy Cross's coach was
                now sacrificing goats in front of a golden 8-armed elephant statue, pleading with
                whoever would listen to save his team from this marauding pack of blue and gold
                sharks. But the feast wasnt over yet, and Sticksy decided to grab a mouthful by
                slamming one past the keeper in the 76th minute. And just when you thought Holy
                Cross could take no more, Cowie tears the beating heart out of the opposition and
                devours it for dessert by scoring the fourth and final goal in the 82nd minute.
                The lone official mercifully blows his whistle and Holy Cross walk from the pitch
                like zombies, they couldn't comprehend what had just happened to them and as they
                looked to their coach for support they found a shattered man blubbering "make them
                stop, make them stop." as he rocked back and forth on his haunches.&nbsp;

                <br/><br/>
                Our heroes have taken a mighty step forward in defending their premiership this
                weekend and Holy Cross have learnt a valuable lesson... thou shalt not worship false
                idols... not when your up against Crusher's Crusaders.&nbsp;
