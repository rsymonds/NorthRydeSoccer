                Opening game of the season come around all so slow but is finally here bringing all
                but 1 player making their débuts for North Ryde Soccer club. The proud boys wearing
                their new boots, socks, jerseys and pants started off strong and as we know Saints
                United always come to the grounds ready to play, but the mini North Ryde boys were
                up for the challenge.&nbsp;
                <img class="bottom noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_smiling.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                Big bustling Nick has taken some pointers from big brother Jarrod opening the scoring
                for North Ryde with some hard work up the middle of the park leaving the ball in the
                back of the net on more than one occasion. Jack turned up the heat mid way through
                the first half with some bustling time on the ball out on the fingers once his
                attention was away from waving to the large team fan base on the side line. And wow
                what a start from Hayden scoring in his first appearance in the blue and gold, taking
                nothing from Dad (retired veteran of North Ryde), Hayden can score goals, some nice
                close dibbling skills giving Hayden good field position for his first.
                <br/><br/>
                North Ryde welcomes back Felix with some enthusiastic play around the middle, giving
                our boys better field position, backed up by Jayden's strong defence down in the
                defensive part of the park. Cooper the work horse never giving in showed what the
                Cassettini boys have done and continue to do, Happy Birthday Dad (Rob).
                <br/><br/>
                Great to see everyone down at the ground giving support to our up and coming soccer
                stars and I'm sure like me, loved every minute. It was a great start boys and keep
                up the good work and continue to enjoy yourselves.
                <br/><br/>
                Man of the match was awarded to Jack Ando for having fun and having a go.&nbsp;

                It was the opening of the season and the team was looking forward to kick off. It
                was a beautiful Saturday morning and the field was perfect.
                <br/><br/>
                <img class="noborder imgtopright" src="images/photos/u6/20100417_u6_reda_1.jpg">
                The team had a great start. Alex and Archie were in there right away. Will and
                Jayden both tried their hardest. Cameron and Lucas, came on after 5 minutes and
                contributed a lot.
                <br/><br/>
                Will ran well and was often found in open spaces. Jayden had moments of full
                commitment. Archie started the goal count and after two goals took to the team
                approach, making great passes of the ball. He could have been mistaken for Lionel
                Messi, scoring a brilliant lob goal later in the game.&nbsp;
                <img class="middle noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_smiling.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                Alex followed up and scored a great goal, and was close to putting a second one
                in the net. Cameron did some great running and had a beautiful turn and kick up
                the sideline. Lucas had his midfield defence hat on today, with some excellent
                blocks, great passing of the ball and defending back.
                <br/><br/>
                Although a small loss, there were a lot of positives. The season is looking to
                be a fantastic experience for everyone.
                <br/><br/>
                Congratulations to the player of the week: Archie&nbsp;

                The boys all did an outstanding job and played well together in their first game
                as a team. Ashton and Ben led the team with their experience while Oliver, Toby,
                Max and Ryan were fantastic in their first ever game of soccer.&nbsp;

                There was a lot of excitement for the first game of the season as we awaited kick-off.
                It was a beautiful autumn morning complete with lovely sunshine. We had our full team
                of players today. There was a lot of nervous energy and then the whistle blew. They
                were off.
                <br/><br/>
                North Ryde White A team started well against All Saints Hunters Hill B. It was a
                fairly even first half with both teams scoring goals. We saw some excellent attacking
                work from Isaak and Ibrahim and both players had great goal kicks.&nbsp;
                <img class="middle noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_smiling.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                The second half saw the other team dominate a little more than us. There was some
                great defending from Dom and Emma. We saw Jake and Leo doing some terrific assistance
                and a great dribbling run from Sam. Emma did some great passes. Some second half goals
                were scored.
                <br/><br/>
                A great game was played by the Under 7 White A team today. Our player of the week award
                goes to Isaak who was persistent in following the play and the ball.&nbsp;

                <br/><br/>
                Big trip, great day and a heap of goals out there in the sticks at Glenhaven but
                worth every minute driving to see these boys put on such a great spectacle. Straight
                from the start the ref struggled keeping up with the pace of the game with the goals
                coming thick and fast.
                <br/><br/>
                Rampaging Blake's ferocious hunger for the ball put the lads in good field position
                straight from the whistle with Jarrod again showing us how to take it to the goal in
                easy fashion along with Luke Ando following on from last year with a goal and a great
                deal of strength on the ball.&nbsp;
                <img class="middle noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_smiling.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                Structure and field position was obvious with Jay's strength at the back with desperate
                sliding tackles defending shots on goal and Luke M showing us composure also at the
                back giving good team play up and around the fringe's time and time over leading to
                more goals. Good signing of Aden this year just added to the skills and goal tally,
                scoring machine. Caiden again shows us how well he reads the game in anticipating the
                cover defence with good passes to the forwards.
                <br/><br/>
                All across the park was dominated from the North Ryde boys and was a joy to watch but
                hard to keep up with play when refereeing.&nbsp;
                <img class="bottom noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_embarassed.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                Great start to the year with Luke Ando taking the man of the match for his strength on
                the ball with great dribbling and passing.
                <br/><br/>
                Keep it going and enjoy it boys.&nbsp;

                A warm sunny day for the first round of competition. Being school holidays we had a
                couple of players away, so our 7 players played the whole game against an opposition
                team that had 3 reserves and were bringing fresh legs onto the field regularly.
                <br/><br/>
                It was an exciting game where the teams were going goal for goal. Some good passing,
                great running, and use of free space shows the potential of the team. Daniel P and
                William each played a half as goalie and made some good saves. Zach ran many lengths
                of the field, Alex achieved 4 kicks in a row and then retrieved the ball from an
                opposition player in one nice attacking play. Danny made some good passes, and goals
                to Daniel B & Tim were celebrated by all.&nbsp;

                So much for winter. Or autumn for that matter. Saturday morning became progressively
                warmer as the day wore on, ignoring the expected decline in temperature for this
                time of year in favour of pushing the stamina and endurance of the U10 players to
                the max, who, for their part, were already facing up to the dubious challenge of
                the 2009 premiership title-holders Normanhurst Eagles.
                <br/><br/>
                <img class="noborder imgtopleft" src="images/photos/u10/20100417_u10_div1_2.jpg">
                The heat did not appear to affect the players, however, and to their credit the
                fitness of both sides was admirable in their ability to give it everything they
                had for the full duration of the game.
                <br/><br/>
                Normanhurst came out of the starting blocks at full tilt and dominated the first
                ten minutes of the game with impressive speed and a slick passing game, but were
                unable to convert any of their opportunities onto the scoreboard. The North Ryde
                defence held firm during these initial exchanges until they started to find their
                feet midway through the second half. Their passing shots were on song and excellent
                ball was being fed through the midfield, creating several opportunities for the
                forwards. Their first goal, however, came in rather incongruous circumstances when
                Adam's corner kick was fumbled in the goal mouth and crept over the line after an
                unfortunate rally of what appeared to be pinball-style ricochets between keeper
                and defender.
                <br/><br/>
                Their second goal was more stylish, and reminiscent of the second goal scored against
                West Pennant Hills a week ago. The ball raced through to the forwards at pace with
                some smart switching between the defence and midfield, and the ubiquitous Shannon
                was on hand to collect it just inside the keepers box and punch it past both defender
                and keeper. A great movement and a great goal, but a thought must be spared for the
                Normanhurst keeper whose balance was momentarily thwarted when the defender directly
                in front of him instinctively flung his foot out and deflected the ball in his attempt
                to intercept the shot at goal.
                <br/><br/>
                <img class="noborder imgtopright" src="images/photos/u10/20100417_u10_div1_3.jpg">
                Two goals up at the break was a rare luxury against this polished opponent, but North
                Ryde had put their backs into it where it counted in all aspects of their game, solid
                defence, good passing shots, and creating opportunities up front. Patrick and Tom H
                both had a cracking game in the defence and midfield, winning many of their 50 - 50
                exchanges, while Tim once again put his body on the line to keep the scoreline secure.&nbsp;
                <img class="middle noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_thumbs_up.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                The second half began in a similar manner as the first half had for North Ryde.
                Normanhurst were again in the driving seat, pushing our defences to the limit and
                we had to dig deep to keep the blue jerseys at bay. There was a period of some
                relatively desperate defence in the first few minutes and balls were being cleared
                off the goal line on more than one occasion. Normanhurst finally broke the barrier
                with a timely movement and scored their first to bring the goal difference back to
                within one.
                <br/><br/>
                True to form, North Ryde once again dragged themselves out of the doldrums and began
                to maintain consistent and lengthier possession of the ball, spreading it out wide
                and fizzing through the midfield once again. Jett and Tom M used their speed and
                strength on the left and right sides of the field respectively to work the ball
                forward while Charlie and David kept the midfield engine ticking over. Jack, Oscar
                and Christopher secured the defence while Adam and Shannon went sniffing for further
                opportunities up front. The momentum was back with the team and they are a joy to
                watch when they get their tails up. They had several more shots on goal that either
                went begging or were kept out, although Adam's last-ditch attempt in the dying seconds
                of the game very nearly snuck under the keeper's diving body.
                <br/><br/>
                The score remained at 2 - 1 in North Ryde's favour until the final whistle. All the
                players from both teams played the match in good spirit and did well to push each
                other so hard for the entire duration of the game. Well done North Ryde on two
                consecutive wins against strong teams in the competition, and for putting into
                practise all the bits and bobs that Pauline feeds you during the week.&nbsp;

                It was an unusually hot autumn morning, but that didn't stop our U10 team turning
                up the heat against Epping YMCA!
                <br/><br/>
                Laurence did a great job as goalie during the first half of the game, and managed
                to stop 3 goals before Epping YMCA finally snuck one in.
                <br/><br/>
                Peter, Nicholas and Jack demo'd their fantastic dribbling skills, and all
                <br/><br/><br/>

                came very close to getting goals, but it was Harrison's superb effort that payed
                off after his swift run down the field to beat the half time whistle, scoring the
                only goal for NRS.&nbsp;

                Peter performed well as goalie during the second half of the game, not letting a
                single ball get passed him. Matthew continually surprised Epping YMCA with huge
                kicks, as

                well as a header, while Saxon and Jordan did a terrific job intercepting the ball,
                and then passing it to their teammates.
                <br/><br/>
                Andrhea reminded us that the game is also about having fun, with her smile never
                leaving her face as she attacked her opponents.&nbsp;

                <br/><br/>
                Our entire team never stopped working hard, and whilst we played a brilliant
                attacking game, our opponents responded with solid defence, hence the final score
                being 1 all. Thanks to both teams for providing what us spectators call a "great
                match".

                At kick off time there were only 7 North Ryde players on the pitch, this grew to
                10 and these 10 brave souls certainly got their money's worth! Playing on the 5
                acres of Magdala when you are only 9 and a bit (with some of them still only 8)
                certainly has its challengers.

                Not to be disheartened, the boys were great in spreading the ball wide! This is
                something they have learned at training and it caught Beecroft out on several
                occasions.
                <br/><br/>
                Player of the match Sebby fed the ball to Ben on several occasions and Ben ran
                himself into the ground heading 'up the wing' looking for options. Salim was very
                keen to test out his new knowledge of settling into the right position.
                <br/><br/>
                Julian and Adam were relentless in clearing the ball out time and again AND trotting
                back into their positions. Massie had a quiet game by his standards, but every time
                <img class="noborder imgright" src="images/photos/u10/20100417_u10_div5_3.jpg">
                he got the ball, the crowd rose as one! Benyad continues to impress with his
                versatility and keenness to impress.
                <br/><br/>
                Beecroft had much of the play in the first half and the 2-0 score line at oranges
                had the lads in a good position to pounce in the second half.
                <br/><br/>
                A soft penalty against us helped to make the score 4-0 with North Ryde being in a
                good position to score a few times with great passes from Makoto and Ethan. Pranav
                was very brave to last the whole game and tackled himself into the ground.&nbsp;

                Well done boys, keep up the great listening at training and keep enjoying your
                soccer!

                Our 2nd match of the season was against Glenhaven at Magdala at 10.15am. Our team
                started off strong attacking Glenhaven's goal. Glenhaven defended strongly but towards
                the end of the first half, Jackson had a great shot at goal but missed and hit the
                crossbar. The score at half time was nil all.
                <br/><br/>
                After a pep talk from Phil, our coach, we started playing the second half. Our goalie,
                Daniel V, saved all attempts of goals by Glenhaven. The backs defended strongly and
                the mid-field moved the ball quickly for our forwards to attack Glenhaven's goal.
                <br/><br/>
                Matt scored the 1st goal from a penalty kick after a hand ball ruling. Our 2nd goal
                was the combination of the entire team passing to each other with Mitchell scoring.
                The 3rd goal came from an excellent corner from Jay and Lukas heading the ball into
                the back of the net.&nbsp;

                Saturday in the heat to fill in for our team, Shannon and Adam. Both boys played
                excellent games.

                One of the Club's new teams for 2010, the mighty Under 12/6's secured its first points
                for the season, when they produced an entertaining 0-0 draw against the West Pennant
                Hills-Cherrybrook Lions.
                <br/><br/>
                A free flowing match saw plenty of chances on goal by both teams. In attack, our halves
                started to feed some quality ball through to the forwards. Will, Tom, Alex and Andrew
                can only continue to improve in this role and their obvious enthusiasm was great to
                see.&nbsp;
                <img class="middle noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_smiling.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                Up front Bezhad worked hard on the wing chasing everything that came near him. New
                signing Jackson was a real revelation with a number of great attacking runs and was
                unlucky not to bag a goal.
                <br/><br/>
                Opposition chances were expertly thwarted firstly by some well organised defending by
                Connor, Lucas, Kevin and Karan. For his efforts Kevin was player of the week. The
                defending was matched by some superb goal keeping by Dominic in the first half and
                Cameron in the second half. Cameron in particular deserves to be singled out for his
                last gasp save against what turned out to be the very last kick of the match before
                the ref blew full time! Hearts in mouths there for a moment for all spectators and
                officials on the North Ryde side of the pitch!!
                <br/><br/>
                It was great to get the full team together for the first time and judging by the
                enthusiasm displayed by all the boys, the coaches a confident that with the 12/6s will
                prove to be a competitive little force in the season ahead.&nbsp;

                The first game of the season against Eastwood St Andrews was a hard game against a
                very polished side, with our boys going down 7- 0. The absence of 4 regular squad
                members was always going to make this a difficult assignment.
                <br/><br/>
                The boys who played all tried hard and their were some encouraging performances most
                notably by Sam B who made some excellent saves and showed great anticipation in goal.
                Well done Sam!&nbsp;

                Ryan N had his best game so far and showed glimpses of his true ability with a new
                found degree of effort and commitment. Kenny R, James and Gavin H as well as William
                G playing his first game as a forward all played strongly and showed signs that they
                could develop as a strong attacking unit. Liam T played a strong captain's game and
                continually tried to rally and organise the team at the back. Special mention to
                Chris B and Benjamin H our two Under 14 super subs who were in no way overawed by the
                experience of playing two years above their age. Well done and thank you to both you
                and to your parent's and coach for allowing you to help us out, you both played
                strongly and should be proud of your efforts.&nbsp;

                If there is one area we really need to work on it is defence! The marking of opposing
                players was ineffectual and almost non existent and on several occasions opposing
                players were allowed to run without being seriously challenged or harassed for the
                ball it almost seemed that they were being escorted down the field by our players.
                Tackle, jostle, harass but don't just let them run. Get a bit mean about them having
                the ball.
                <img class="middle noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_angry.gif">
                Remember also if you are first to the ball and the team has possession that means
                less defending!
                <br/><br/>
                The result from Saturday shows that we need an improved commitment, attitude and
                attendance at Thursday night training sessions. The team cannot hope to be competitive
                at this age unless everyone is committed to training and are prepared to do the hard
                work required for the full 90 minutes of the session. This team has an outstanding
                knowledgeable coach who can make this a successful season for all involved but to do
                this he needs your cooperation and a positive attitude at training. So having said
                that it would be great to see 100% attendance at training this Thursday with
                everyone's mind on one thing... Soccer!! (or Football if you prefer).
                <br/><br/>
                You boys are good enough to turn that result around and have a great season if you
                commit to each other and the team.&nbsp;

                On a steamy Saturday afternoon, North Ryde's finest gathered at Magdala Oval and
                prepared themselves for a torrid battle with the Thornleigh Thunderblolts. Our heroes
                were still smarting from the loss last week, and were ready to bounce back, even though
                some of their best players were unable to attend this weeks fixture.
                <br/><br/>
                The game started with our kick off and the ball was passed firmly to the backline. The
                blue and golds then found space at all parts of the ground and proceeded to give their
                opposition a lesson in the fine art of keeping possesion. It was 10 mins into the game
                when Thornleigh finally got to touch the ball, when the ball ricochetted off the cross
                bar to clip a bewildered Thornleigh sweeper up the side of his head.
                <br/><br/>
                Our heroes dominated play and were rewarded in the 30th min when their light-footed
                striker "Sticksy" blasted one passed the hapless keeper. They jogged to the sheds at
                1-0, inhaled a few oranges and eagerly took their positions ready to convert this
                dominant display into goals in the back of the net.
                <br/><br/>
                The second half followed the same script as the first and in the 53rd min "Cowie"
                opened up his account to make it 2-0. With Cowies tail up, he took on the defence again
                to put a searing cross to the far post where an unbeleivable diving header from the
                right midfielder "Crouchy" slammed into the back of the net in the 60th min.&nbsp;

                Thornleigh now down 3-0, desperately attack and realising they couldn't penetrate this
                rock-wall defence try a toe-punted shot from 30 yards out. The ball swirled and curled
                through the air, just clipping the outstretched diving hand of the athletic keeper and
                finding the inside of the post to bring the score to 3-1. After the game Thornleigh was
                heard saying how they wish they had never scored that goal, because our heroes then
                attacked with a ferocity that was biblical in its vengeful ruthlessness.
                <br/><br/>
                At 75 mins Cowie makes it a double... 4-1. At 81 mins, Sticksy see's Cowies double...
                and then raises the stakes with another goal in the 86th to get his hatrick for the day
                and bring the score to 6-1.&nbsp;

                This result will send a tremor of fear throughout this competition, and hopefully the
                opposition teams will learn from Thornleigh's mistake, and not make these proud men
                angry by daring to score against them.
