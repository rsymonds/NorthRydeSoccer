                This was a great match in the first half with both teams competing well for the
                ball and plenty of opportunities to score. Some great play and excellent on the
                ball runs from this weeks piston cup holder Maxwell, delivered two nice goals
                and fairly brought the White Ants in ahead at the half way point.&nbsp;

                <br/><br/>
                Ryde Saints only goal came at the end of the first half. A nice slow deflection
                somehow managing to confuse the North Ryde defense who had a wall of three
                players on the line.
                <br/><br/>
                The second half was a more one sided affair. Some silky soccer moves in attack
                saw Toby net yet another hat-trick, joined by Max and Ashton with two to his
                name. The team defended well to the Saints breaking runs with Ben making several
                crucial tackles. Great hussle from Ryan and Oliver in the midfield made sure the
                Saints didn't have a chance to think and the boys did a great job of marking up
                on the set kicks. Final score, 8-1.
                <br/><br/>
                Well done, great concentration from everyone!&nbsp;

                This game had a real World Cup feel to it - a few interesting decisions by the
                referee, plus many of us (parents & kids) seemingly half-asleep possibly from
                staying up too late the night before.
                <br/><br/>
                Perhaps a few vuvuzelas could have helped here.&nbsp;

                <br/><br/>
                Anyway, an OK effort here by the team who all did their best. Christian picked
                up a goal as always, and well done to Alexis for picking up the Player of the
                Week award for her strong efforts in defence.&nbsp;

                <br/><br/>
                I hope everyone enjoys the a week break and comes out firing for the next match.

                What a great match! The last time these teams played each other it ended up as
                a 4 all draw and this game was just as good, even more so when the Ref got
                nutmegged twice! Try to concentrate on the game when that happens next time,
                boys, instead of laughing so much. I didn't find it amusing at all.&nbsp;

                The boys lost by the odd goal in nine but played a great game full of skill and
                verve, the pick being Tom "Bomb" Bain's turn and defence splitting pass to put
                Finn in for the first goal, for which "Bomb" deservedly won man of the match.
                Finn went on to score another two goals, officially earning the name of Team
                Goalhanger, while Tom got the other.
                <br/><br/>
                This was all built on great defensive work by the whole team, Hamish and Will
                especially patrolling the backline and making some great covering tackles and
                then distributing the ball well. Anirrudh, who is in line for Most Improved
                Player of the Year, had another great game winning and chasing lots of ball.
                <br/><br/>
                It was a hard game and without a substitute, as Evan, another star of a star
                team, was away, the guys tired by the end but they didn't give up trying for
                that elusive goal to draw the match. It was great to see all of the boys getting
                their heads up to see what options were on and then deciding to pass, run or
                shoot.&nbsp;

                The result might not say it but the way you guys played the game was a win in
                everyone's eyes! And remember boys have fun and... NUTTIES!!!

                It was an action packed game in the cold conditions at Magdala. Both teams were
                evenly matched although a mainly defensive game for NRS which is how STU snuck
                in a few quick goals.

                The white bees had fun (as always) and decided that they would show everyone
                at half time which goals they were going to score into by diving in them (as
                seen in the picture).&nbsp;

                The white bees played consistently well, especially when
                the game was physical at times from over-excited STU players.
                <br/><br/>
                Kevin made a few great attacking moves as did Luca and Rishi. Oliver, Emily
                and Cameron shows some strong tackling and passing. Our focus will be on
                attacking, dribbling the ball and passing.
                <br/><br/>
                The player of the match this week went to Emily Duffy for trying her best and
                making some great tackles this week.&nbsp;

                This week we played Pacific Hills Dural at North Ryde Oval.
                <br/><br/>
                Well done team on a great effort this week. We played exceptionally well again
                and were challenged by a great team with great skills and we learnt a lot from
                their teamwork.
                <br/><br/>
                Final score was 10 - nil to Pacific Hills Dural. All of our team tried really
                hard throughout the field and showed their true sportsmen ship from start to
                finish and never gave up. Well done again to all of the team.&nbsp;

                A cold and windy Monash Park played host to the North Ryde v West Ryde derby, when
                the mighty Under 12-6's confirmed that they are a genuine team to be reckoned with
                by securing their third win on the trot with a hard fought victory.
                <br/><br/>
                Statistically the boys went into the match on the back of 2 good wins plus an
                earlier win in the season over their local West Ryde rivals. However the first
                half was a tightly contested affair which saw North Ryde going into the break
                at 2-1, but with the Rovers coming back hard.
                <br/><br/>
                Fortunately a rousing half time speech by Coach Jacob proved just the tonic and the
                boys turned on the entertainment in the second half, which saw some great teamwork
                around the park that lead to 2 more quality goals. Notable efforts were Will in
                defensive mid; Alex with some great ball-playing for his strikers; Lucas, Connor
                and K really tightening up in defence and supporting Dom in goals who pulled off
                some great saves.&nbsp;

                While special thanks go to the Lukas; Matt; Josh; and Nic from the U11's who helped
                fill the team sheet and the goal sheet.
                <br/><br/>
                The deserving playing of the week was Andrew who continues to improve with every
                match and this game was no different.&nbsp;
