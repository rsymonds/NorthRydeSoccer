                Back to back wins for the first time this season by the White B's, who are looking
                totally different to the 6 young kids who started their first match back at the
                end of April. There is definitely a real confidence within the team now and rather
                than standing around and watching the game happen, everyone is now fighting for
                the ball and kicking it forward or desperately running back to snuff out any
                attacking plays by the opposition.
                <br/><br/>
                Player of the Week this week went to Blake who was basically involved in
                everything, whether it was bringing the ball back in defence or making scything
                runs through the middle which resulted in a couple of goals. Idan was equally
                dangerous in attack, also grabbing a double as well as assisting an opposition
                player score an own goal. Christian kept his goal scoring record intact with a
                blistering drive into the back of the net, and Reilly mirrored this effort in the
                2nd half with a similar goal of his own. Alexis & Joshua both put in good efforts
                mainly in defence ensuring the opposition didn't venture too often into goal
                scoring territory.&nbsp;

                How good was this performance? The Crazy Gang played some lovely football and got
                a nice win after they lost their first games of the season in the last two weeks.
                Crazy Finn, Crazy Evan and Crazy Hamish scored most of the goals but superb
                tackling, passing and dribbling from Crazy Bomb, Crazy Will and Crazy Annirudh
                were the bedrock of the win. A couple of falcons (no tears), some great nutties
                and lots of falling over added to the fun of the game - well it made me laugh.&nbsp;
                <img class="middle noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_smiling.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                All the boys are playing really well and are coming along great with their
                tackling, shooting and dribbling. Each of them are increasing their individual
                talents week by week and as each unit gets stronger, the team gets stronger.
                However I think it is the passing that amazes most of the parents. The boys are
                stringing sets of 3 to 4 passes together, even going across the pitch deep in our
                half through four boys from one wing to the other. As the boys have realised that
                they have the option of passing, you see they are less inclined to crowd the
                player with the ball, moving into space instead, on the understanding that a
                pass may come. All of this is mainly due to the boys themselves, getting their
                heads up, seeing the options and deciding themselves what to do. In defence they
                are getting a good idea of marking players or space to disrupt the other team.
                <br/><br/>
                In all the excitement I think most of the parents lost track of the score.
                General consensus was that the boys scored between 6 and 8 goals, with 3 against.
                The win was good but the way you played the game was outstanding - well done,
                boys, we are all proud of you.&nbsp;

                Lots of great stops in goal by Henry in the first half, we often saw him wiping
                his brow in relief!&nbsp;

                Zac cleared the ball magnificently midfield and Daniel B backed him up with great
                driving of the ball though the midfield areas and defended a late attempt for goal
                by the other team. William stopped the other side from scoring by demonstrating
                the classic "pullback" in our own goal area - what a great save!
                <br/><br/>
                Half time pep talk was serious with the concept of the "ball in the garage"
                embraced by all players.
                <br/><br/>
                In the second half Danny had the rest of the team in fits of laughter as goal
                keeper he displayed how to create a "reverse goal" but this was short lived when
                Daniel B's persistence paid off to chase the ball and secure a long kick goal for
                our team.
                <br/><br/>
                William's kick of the centre ball went well into other teams side and Alex managed
                to get the ball off a girl during play! Zac showed some more great dribbling and
                our second goal came from lots of weaving past defenders by Daniel B. Henry had a
                solid game and was rewarded with 2points along with Zac.
                <br/><br/>
                Player of the week went to Daniel B as he didn't stop all game and tried all the
                time.&nbsp;

                It wasn't the result that we expected for NRS today but our boys showed so much
                strength and determination. They never gave up. NRS had a few chances but could
                not get through the NMH defence. Eli and Charlie tried to get the ball out to play
                but NMH seemed to keep our boys in our half and our defenders (Tom H, Tom M, Jett
                and David) had to work very hard to keep NMH away from our goal. Tim was outstanding
                and kept himself cool to save many goals. NMH scored 2 goals in the first half.
                Their football skills were excellent.
                <br/><br/>
                Second half our first goal, thanks to Adam and a great pass by Shannon. Patrick,
                Chris and Oscar worked hard to support and put the ball through. We thought we could
                equalise the score but our defence was no match for NMH as they scored their third
                goal. Our boy's determination was still in check and we narrowly missed another
                opportunity to score a goal but our hopes came alive when Adam kicked a high ball
                over the keeper's head and into the net to reward us with our second goal for the
                day. NMH kept Jack busy all day but he put up a great fight to stop their progress
                in our territory. With a few minutes left for the second half, NMH managed to put
                another one on the score board. When the final whistle blew the score was NMH 4 -
                NRS 2. Congratulations NMH and well done NRS. We will be the winners next time we

                On Saturday 24 July North Ryde played against Epping YMCA in the last official
                match of the season draw. The parents/friends were there to support our team
                as usual.
                <br/><br/>
                The fields were muddy and the boy's minds were not always on the job of playing
                soccer or winning the game. There seemed to be a lot of untapped potential out
                there today.&nbsp;

                We had a loss today 4-0 to Epping YMCA. There were 3 goals scored in the first
                half and 1 in the second. Thanks to the goal keepers Saxon and Andhrea who were
                kept busy during the game. Both goal keepers saved many goals.
                <br/><br/>
                Good Luck to our team in the last 3 Pennant matches of the season.&nbsp;

                What a day, what a great team effort, what a result!
                <br/><br/>
                Boys you made each and every one of your supporters and families at the ground
                very proud of you all. To win that game against a side that has dominated much
                of the year showed remarkable character,courage and commitment. At last all your
                hard work throughout the season was rewarded. Barry and I are both very proud of
                you all and extremely pleased for you to achieve this result, the smiles on your
                faces Saturday after such a challenging season makes it all worthwhile.&nbsp;

                This was by far the best day of the season so far, with every player present on
                the day contributing strongly to a fine win. Starting with Sam B in goals who
                snuffed out any of Eastwood's goal scoring opportunities with some exceptional
                saves there was not a weakness in the side. The back 4 of Victor T, Leo W, Josh C
                and Matthew U played unchanged for the full game and their efforts and challenges
                snuffed out many attacking raids and assisted Sam B in keeping a clean slate. Well
                done to you all for your stamina and courage to keep going for the full game.
                <br/><br/>
                The mid fielders Liam T, Lewis B, Gavin H, Tyler R, Ryan N, Tim B and also Scott J
                all showed remarkable composure and determination in winning many 50-50 balls and
                their domination and commitment to each other helped pave the way for this win.
                A special mention to Scott J whose contribution playing although ill typified
                the level of commitment shown by the team on the day.Well done Scott hope you
                are better now.
                <br/><br/>
                William G and James H playing up front continually found their opposing backs
                out with their pace and skill. They continually had the opposing defence under
                pressure and they were ably assisted by some excellent balls from the midfield,
                strong clearances by the backs and some excellent long balls from Sam B in goals.
                The pressure applied finally paid off in the second half when a promising attacking
                raid resulted in a fumble by the Eastwood goal keeper which Jame H pounced on to
                hammer home. This goal was well deserved as the team had much of the running for
                the entire game creating many goal-scoring opportunities although for a long while
                it once again looked as though the bounce of the ball would cost us a win, however
                determination,courage and a strong team spirit and belief in each other was
                finally rewarded.&nbsp;

                Well done team! We now have 3 round robin games to play for the Pennant. After
                this last effort you have given yourselves a really good chance of winning this.

                are available.
