                How nice to start the day at Magdala home ground for an 8:30am game. We were 2
                players down this week which meant there were no reserves for the U6 Green and
                in there true spirit they rose to the challenge with sheer delight that no one
                had to take a turn on the sideline.

                The Game started and within minutes Blake had secured the first goal and the
                team and spectators were suddenly not as cold from the jumping up and down in
                excitement.
                <br/><br/>
                The goals kept coming and all the players were showing there foot skills,
                passing, trapping and special mention goes to Will for his control of the ball
                both in attack and defence. Will took an almightily slide and his bleeding knee
                did not stop him from supporting his team mates and scoring a great goal (see
                photo).
                <br/><br/>
                The final tally Jasmine 3 goals, Blake 3 goals, Will & Christian a goal a piece.
                Player of the week this week went to Blake for an all round great game.

                A crisp sunny morning, damp pitch and planes heading in to land at Mascot
                greeted the boys for their home match against Northern HFC at Magdala.
                <br/><br/>
                With Lachlan back from illness we were brimming with confidence as Luke
                made a break down the left wing to score the first goal of the match.
                <br/><br/>
                A collision not long after resulted in a couple of injuries that would test
                the depth of the reserves bench.
                <br/><br/>
                Northern HFC were formidable opponents. The boys show great resilience with
                Cameron working tirelessly to turn defence into offence.
                <br/><br/>
                Liam was solid all game, and Alex managed a great cross to score another goal
                in the second half.
                <br/><br/>
                Cameron’s defensive efforts earned him the player of the match award for this
                week.

                We had a fresh early start to the morning at Morrison Bay. Our training is
                looking like it is sinking in. We were attacking the ball more and defending
                well.
                <br/><br/>
                We were down at half time 4-2 but after some apples and oranges we were in
                fighting spirits, and managed to score 4 goals in the second half.
                <br/><br/>
                A good game played by all, encouragement award to Georgia for attacking, and
                player of the match to Alexis for her tackling and positioning.

                The boys were 1 short this week and were missing one of their key players but
                that did not stop them getting a big win for their first win of the season.
                <br/><br/>
                Player of the Week, Oliver scored his first goal ever and went on to score
                another 4 just in case anyone missed it.
                <br/><br/>
                The boys had a lot of fun while Ryde Saints turned on each other in frustration.
                They are getting much more awareness about defending and clearing the ball away
                from their goal. The team is improving really well together.

                Fontenoy Oval played host to our 5 round encounter with the Macquarie Dragons.
                The game started with both teams pressing and battling for ball control, but it
                was the Dragons to score first when a kick got through our defence. With a lot
                of luck the Dragons scored again.
                <br/><br/>
                Luke had a number of great shot at the goals which just missed the net, Jayden
                once again defended extremely well and saved many opportunities, whilst Alex,
                Will, Lucas, Bailey and Dillan all pressured the Dragons defence.
                <br/><br/>
                With the team desperate for points we found ourselves out of position and the
                Dragons scored a soft goal where being in position would have stopped them scoring.
                At half time down 3 goals we had to come out and we needed to keep the ball and
                most importantly score some goals. Our top goal scorer for the year Alex (who’s
                scored an amazing 5 goals) scored our first goal. We continued to have shots and
                Luke helped out with a wonderfully controlled header, just before the final
                whistle the Dragons scored again. Even though the score was 1-4 this game could
                have very easily gone our way, hold you head up high boys the win is coming.
                <br/><br/>

                What a fantastic team of kids we have. A rare but beautiful sight, every weekend
                to see a whole team of happy children run onto the field.
                <br/><br/>
                This week, on such a freezing cold morning I thought our team might have a fight
                on their hands with the opposition warming up for a good half hour before the
                game. But North Ryde showed what they were made of right up until the final
                whistle and the score showed this. The goals were shared around with Hayden,
                Emily and Cameron all scoring 2 each, Matthew scored his first goal of the season
                (it was only a matter or time!) and Josh scoring 1 as well.
                <br/><br/>
                North Ryde are looking more like a team and less like individual players with a
                lot of passing and looking for team mates. Special mention goes to the Duffy kids
                today with all of them now showing the impressive kick back skill which has saved
                many goals. But today the player of the match went to Hayden who was involved in
                everything, great defence, attack and teamwork plus he has now scored a total of
                8 goals for his team.

                Saturday's game  was a great win for our boys. Even with loads of cuddles and
                rumbling going on within our team the boys still managed to score the goals and
                win. Jack dominated the goal scoring but the highlight was when Ryan scored his
                first goal of the season and his proud as punch reaction after...

                We had the home ground advantage this week and the sun was shining. The game
                started with a lot of enthusiasm and Brooklyn secured a goal within the first
                10 minutes of the game.
                <br/><br/>
                The All Saints team were very strong in their positioning and able to find free

                space for the throw ins and passes which assisted them in scoring 4 goals before
                half time.
                <br/><br/>
                A special mention goes to Isaak and Liam for their strong support in the defence
                throughout the game they supported both Oliver and Declan when they were in the
                goals. After the half time break the team regrouped and played a lot more
                attacking half and they were unlucky not to break through the All Saints goal.
                The U8 Brown teams positioning and passing improved in the second half.
                <br/><br/>
                Luca was fast to position himself for the opportunity to intercept the opposition
                and made several great tackles. Declan made some great saves and also some
                excellent goalie kicks. Jake was consistent in his tackling and passing as was
                Sam. Ben made some charges through the centre and Oliver also made some break
                away runs from half way.
                <br/><br/>
                The final score was 1-5 to All Saints, although the NRS Brown team learnt a lot
                during the game. The player of the week went to Oliver for great positional
                play - Well done!

                This was our second game at West Epping Oval and the boys were keen to get into
                it against Epping YMCA. Unfortunately the Epping boys were as well, quickly
                putting us on the defensive straight away. Within 5 minutes the opposition had
                their first goal despite our desperate defence. The ref was keenly watching out
                for trips and a number of penalties were given away by both sides, one of which
                saw another goal by the other team in the first half to make it 2-0 to them. Also,
                a lot of throw-ins were turned over by both teams because both feet were not
                planted, a good lesson for future to watch out for. Luke Anderson in goal managed
                to deflect a direct shot at goal knocking it over the top of the goal posts.
                <br/><br/>
                At half time, Coach gave the boys some good advice about staying in position and
                to stop kicking across the goal area when they are in our half.  This seemed to
                make a big difference in the second half as the boys maintained their positions
                and started to pass the ball in a more structured way. Jarrod got a penalty kick
                at the opposition’s goal but the goalie managed to get his hands on it.
                Unfortunately early in the second half the opposition managed to kick it in again
                after quickly getting possession off one of our penalties. We followed up with a
                few shots at goal, one of which Daniel skilfully guided in. The other team shot a
                bullet from afar straight at goal, but a superb stop from our goalie Ben B. saved
                the goal.
                <br/><br/>
                At the end of the day the score was 3 - 1 to Epping YMCA, and despite the loss
                our boys were really starting to reap rewards from the training and positional
                awareness. Man of the match went to Ben Jones for maintaining his position in
                defence. Great effort boys!

                We were confronted with a team that was pretty much on par with us and it was a
                hard fought battle from the first whistle. Our team was looking good and showing
                definite signs of picking up some of the training drills. Position play was good
                and players were looking for teammates to pass to. Both teams had a couple of
                opportunites throughout the first half but none played out and the half time
                whistle still saw us at nill all.
                <br/><br/>
                Back out for the second half and it was more of the same with both teams working
                hard at each other. Some frustrating misses from our forwards still had the
                scoresheet blank. Just when our guys seemed to be commanding most of the play
                the opposition managed to get lucky and got a post deflection past riley in goals
                who seemed to have it covered if it weren't for the unlucky bounce. Unfortunately,
                we were on the wrong side of the post deflection luck when one of ours deflected
                out. But a couple of minutes on and Luke Wood did manage to put an equaliser into
                the back of the net. Watching from the side it then looked like our team were
                hungry for the win and they kept the pressure up with a few good attempts.
                Unfortunately, none of them were to pay off and we were greeted with a full time
                whistle with the scores still equal at one a piece. Probably a fitting result for
                two pretty evenly matched teams that both played well - but a little unlucky for
                our boys.
                <br/><br/>
                The team is showing good improvements each week though and seem to be playing
                better with each other. Alan was our standout this week for the certificate and
                looked great all match even though he was playing in a position that he was not
                happy with from the start. He managed to be first to the ball consistently and
                winning it more often than not with passes on to his team mates. The team is
                looking good and we are all looking forward to next week.

                The u10 players and parents braved a very early and chilly start against a as yet
                unbeaten team of Redbacks. However, the North Ryde forwards headed straight to
                the goals, scoring their first brilliant goal before the opposition even had
                time to defrost.
                <br/><br/>
                A second goal, the outcome of excellent passing from the midfield to the strikers,
                took the pressure off the North Ryde team. It was clear that the hours of training
                was paying off for this young team and their dedicated coach and manager. Their
                use of space, passing and technique showed a significant improvement from their
                previous games. Although we took the early lead, the defenders and goalkeeper were
                kept on their toes with some fancy footwork by the opposition. Two goals made it
                through our defense despite valiant defending. Fortunately our team pulled together
                and put two more spectacular goals safely into the net, with a final score of 4-2
                to North Ryde.
                <br/><br/>
                This game was evidence of excellent team work between our boys and we all left the
                field much warmer, beaming in the glow of their great game.

                Our indefatigable eleven-ones re-discovered some of their form in a match against
                Epping Eastwood at the North Ryde Oval this morning, wrapping up a four-nil win
                that will go a long way to bolster the team's much-needed confidence after
                succumbing to a defeat last weekend.
                <br/><br/>
                They hopped onto the front foot from the word go and were so determined to stamp
                their authority on the game that a couple of attempts at goal sailed enthusiastically
                into the upper branches of the large tree behind the goals at the Magdala Road end
                of the park. But some degree of reason started to settle in once the initial
                exchanges were over and the nature and threat of their opponents were realised,
                <img class="noborder imgleft" src="images/photos/u11/20110514_u11_div1_2.jpg">
                and a rebounding ball found the end of David's boot in a low volley that fizzed
                into the back of the net and opened our account for the day.
                <br/><br/>
                We began to dominate play in the Epping Eastwood half of the field, but every now
                and again a ball would sail over the heads of our defence and set off a fifty-metre
                chase by both teams to claim possession of the ball. Jett's superior speed often
                foiled any attempt on our goals, and a special mention goes to Jack who worked the
                ball, cool as you like, from deep within the North Ryde territory to effectively
                turn a deperate situation into an attacking opportunity. One such attack ended at
                the feet of Lachlan on the left wing who, relishing the prospect of the few seconds
                <img class="noborder imgright" src="images/photos/u11/20110514_u11_div1_3.jpg">
                of space and time that he had at his disposal, powered a curving ball off his left
                boot that flew uninterrupted along it's designated flight path before touching down
                in the top-right corner of the nets, increasing the North Ryde lead by two. The
                third goal come soon afterwards when Oscar P orchestrated a sizzling run past the
                defence in the left midfield and timed a low pass into the centre which David was
                able to charge down and slot in the bottom-left corner without breaking into a
                sweat, taking the goal tally to 3 - 0 at the break.
                <br/><br/>
                The second half was not as successful as the first half in terms of goals scored,
                but the players kept their composure and continued to hone their touch-and-go
                passing game in an effort to maintain possession of the ball. Shannon, the
                ultimate menace to any form of opposition, did not give the defence a moment's
                rest as he dominated the play from his midfield position, and a couple of
                long-range attempts at goal from Eli and Oscar P past an ever-advancing Epping
                Eastwood keeper very nearly found the back of the nets. Sam, our resident tour
                de force whenever a ball lands anywhere in his playing zone, was given an
                opportunity when he lined up a penalty kick from thirty-five metres out. The kick
                was strong and accurate, and momentarily denied entry into the goals by a cluster
                of defenders, but quickly remedied by a quick-thinking Charlie who pounced on the
                rebound and finished job to take the score to 4 - 0, where it remained until the
                end of the game.
                <br/><br/>
                Well done team!

                This game was a big turn around from last week. The North Ryde defence appeared
                a lot more confident. Robert was very solid throughout the game. His big kicks
                <img class="noborder imgleft" src="images/photos/u11/20110514_u11_div3_3.jpg">
                from defence turned the North Epping attackers around several times. He was
                supported by a well organised defence with Benyad, Ben, Adam and Sam playing well.
                <br/><br/>
                Hamish seemed to cover the field. 20 minutes into the first half he was on the
                spot for a through ball and booted it into the back of the net. This put energy
                back into the North Ryde fuel tanks and, a minute before half-time, Hamish found
                a path through the North Epping defenders and scored again.
                <br/><br/>
                The start of the second-half has been a danger period for the boys, but in this
                game we were the danger. After beating off some strong attack with scrambling
                defence, North Ryde pushed the ball to the other end and earned a corner. Robert
                placed it well and there was a mad rumble in front of the goal. Hamish got his
                boot to the ball and it was 3-0.
                <br/><br/>
                There were some stressful periods for the rest of the game, but someone always
                seemed to cut the North Epping players off, or forced them into a poorly aimed
                kick that went out the back. A great hat-trick for Hamish, but the whole team
                deserves credit for this fine win.

                In Joe’s absence, I felt an incredible pressure in offering to do the report for
                the fourth game for a brisk Saturday 14th May 2011 and how would I be able to
                maintain such a high standard? However as the game unfolded into the second half
                the person who was under the greatest pressure was the goalie for Beecroft SC and
                I started to relax.
                <br/><br/>
                The first half started as a well-paced, even game, spread across all areas of the
                paddock. Our Linesman, Peter certainly earned his keep as he worked his way up and
                down the line, as we enjoyed some solid and relentless defence and attack from
                both teams. Ben and Nathan regularly got behind and stopped the ball with headers,
                and then Chris showed his strength in defence by regularly outpacing and tackling
                the opposing forwards and also by stopping a full flight ball with a header and
                clearing the ball back to our forwards.
                <br/><br/>
                At half time the scoreboard was empty and our boys left the field to be greeted
                by Paul with his half time review and motivational talk, the boys were now charged
                up, knew what they had to do and did it, with the second half an even more
                exciting game to watch. Then as I was lured into a false sense of calm it would
                be shattered as a shot from Cameron towards the goal, it bounced off a defender,
                and Luke followed through, with his shot hitting the cross bar. The ball was then
                snatched safely by Beecroft’s goalie. Another run by Luke, an accurate shot at
                goal, and captured by the goalie.
                <br/><br/>
                The first trickle of blood ran from my ears, as I was sitting near the North Ryde
                mums, and they were screaming out their support. A solid run by Mitch, tackled,
                and a corner by Cameron, as he continued to punish the ball, striking the ball
                with a fury. (Side note to Cameron, there is no prize for kicking the ball out
                of the park). More solid defence from North Ryde with Chris sailing the ball back
                down to Kyle, some great ball control, another shot at goal, and the Beecroft
                goalie saving it and the Beecroft defence remained solid. A high fly ball, floated
                down the field, however our goalie Nat held up under the pressure and perfectly
                positioned himself for the bounce and confidently captured it.
                <br/><br/>
                Time for Paul to refresh the field, making his subs and bringing on Tom and
                Daniel. Time for another corner from Cameron, and Ben decided to take his life
                into his own hands and try and head this shot (brave boy), unfortunately the
                ball went out, however Ben was ok. Our boys were now just playing the averages,
                and surely a goal was soon as the Beecroft team was starting to waver. The
                pressure was on, a great run, with a pass to Tom with another quick run and a
                well struck ball = goal.  Score = 1 - 0. Then another run by Tom, a one-two with
                a shot by Kyle. More pressure. Daniel’s turn, he struck the ball, a slight in
                flight curve, and bang, it hit the right post. The ball was back into play, a
                run and positioned by Lewis, back over the Daniel, to sink to the ball into the
                net. Score = 2 - 0.
                <br/><br/>
                Beecroft were starting to tire and slightly overwhelmed by the relentless
                pressure, whereas N.R. were getting stronger, and lifted by the Paul’s half time
                pep talk and breeze of the screams from the sideline spectators. Kyle continued
                to show his strength running the wing, and convincing playing the one-two move.
                Hayden took a hook shot, which was deflected and he had another go, however the
                Beecroft goalie continued to put his body on the line and saved the ball. Tom
                decided that so many of his team mates had hit the actual goal frame that he
                would have a go at it himself and belted a shot into the cross bar, just to
                confuse the defence with the resonating noise from the hit and the consequential
                noise from the screaming mums on the sideline.
                <br/><br/>
                Special thanks to Mark for being the referee in the second half, and his display
                of the splits, as with cat like reflexes he threw his legs open to allow a
                miss-struck ball to pass under him. The game finished with a score of 2 - 0.
                A proud new tradition was started, and Tom accepted his award of 'Man of the
                Cupcake', with a close follow up by Kyle also receiving a cupcake for his effort.
                As Joe normally finishes up. I would like to thank all the parents who came to
                support our team... you do make a loud difference! And I have been assured my
                left eardrum has not been perforated and the trickle of blood will stop in a
                few days, and a special thank you to Paul for your ability to get the best from
                the boys and motivate them, well done!

                After several weeks break due to the rain and a bye, North Ryde AA17s recommenced
                their 2011 season against West Ryde Rovers. Due to injury and unavailability North
                Ryde started with the disadvantage of having only 10 players but despite this they
                started the game strongly bossing the midfield and regularly winning possession in
                the West Ryde half.
                <br/><br/>
                The first 30 minutes saw a few chances fall the way of North Ryde but as half time
                approached it was still 0-0 with West Ryde beginning to get the better of the
                exchanges - the extra man and substitutes starting to have an impact.
                <br/><br/>
                The second half was a more one sided affair with West Ryde beginning to show their
                dominance but a resolute defence kept them at bay with most of their attacking
                raids well read and diffused. At about the hour mark West Ryde created the chance
                that should have won it but some great goal keeping from Ben Waldron and a lucky
                deflection kept the ball out. From there it was close to a defensive drill
                exercise as North Ryde repelled each attacking raid resulting in a well earned
                point after the final whistle called an end to the game at 0-0.
