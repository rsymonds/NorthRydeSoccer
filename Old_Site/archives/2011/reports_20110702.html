                This week was certainly enlightening for the players and family of the U6 Green
                team. The team were pushed, pulled, tripped and kicked by the Rangers and this
                had several of our team upset and injured. The Putney team were warned by both
                coaches to settle down and to play soccer, unfortunately the poor play did not
                cease. The Putney coach even allowed the team to take a corner from next to the
                goal and kick it straight in - interesting to say the least. Luckily the skills
                and good sportsmanship of the North Ryde team shone through with a win and did
                not react in any way during the game.
                <br/><br/>
                Excellent defence from Christian, Will and Blake. William also made some great
                kicks in the midfield. Jasmine was not put off by the hard play and scored 3
                excellent goals, Blake scored a couple of hard hitting goals and Will scored a
                very skilful goal. We are very proud of this little team.
                <br/><br/>
                Player of the week this week was awarded to Blake for his determination and skill,
                even after been carried off twice during the game he soldiered on.

                With almost half the team out with injury or lucky enough to be on holidays the
                boys had no subs and worked hard today. They had to defend well right from the
                start of the game. There was huge enthusiasm for kick ins and a few little
                brothers looking to get in on the action, some future stars coming up!
                <br/><br/>
                Liam worked tirelessly in defense, Lachlan was focused and followed the ball.
                Despite good defending the opposition scored a few times in the first half and
                were hurrying us back on for the second half. Ethan scored a goal early in the
                second half. Luke had a great save and Liam & Lachlan chased the ball well.
                Ethan scored a second goal and then Liam and Luke showed superb team work for
                Luke to score a goal just before the final whistle.
                <br/><br/>
                All of the boys did well to maintain focus, energy and enthusiasm throughout
                the game.
                <br/><br/>
                Player of the match went to Ethan for his consistent kicking, focus and goal
                scoring. Well done to all the boys.

                School holidays had started and unfortunately our boys were already on holidays.
                All Saints attacked and defended as a team while our boys were thinking about
                their 2 weeks off school and what fun they were going to have. It wasn't all
                bad. We did manage to sneak in 2 goals but had 5 scored against us.
                <br/><br/>
                All Saints Hunters Hill defended in packs so any break we made was quickly shut
                down. We just could not find a weak link in the opposition and as the clock
                wound down we could only hope that the bye would freshen us up for the game in
                2 weeks time.

                Our first early start and the Holy Cross field was quite a paddock after the
                rain. The team took to the field and maintained good positioning, Issak was
                excellent in the goals and Liam was strong in attack and defence with some
                excellent runs down the field and was unlucky not to convert what would have
                been the goal of the day - Well done Liam.
                <br/><br/>
                Brooklyn was tackling and sliding through the mud in true form and the game
                was very evenly matched. Sam was unlucky with several good shots on goal.
                Declan was great in the midfield and Oliver and Jake positioned themselves
                well in the forwards and showed their skills.
                <br/><br/>
                The team were happy to be coached by Neil today and he was equally excited
                and proud of the team. Holy Cross broke through just before half time. In the
                second halve Ben played goalie and made some excellent saves. He was unlucky
                after catching a ball and dropping it the shot was converted by the holy cross
                team and another goal was scored later in the match when visibility was limited
                for Ben through the play, what a great effort as Goalie!
                <br/><br/>
                The team are really improving and showing that they are force on the field.
                The player of the week this week went to Brooklyn for his endurance and strength
                in attack and defence as well has being covered in mud through relentless effort.

                This week saw the North Ryde up against Beecroft at North Epping. Goal keepers,
                Harry Grimes and Elliott Cunningham, both did a fantastic job in defending against
                many Beecroft attacks at goal. All up a very entertaining and tight game with both
                sides displaying great skill. Neither side was dominant, but North Ryde, courtesy
                of Anuj did score the first goal two minutes into the match, which co-incidently
                was his first for the season. Well done to Anuj. Play remains tight throughout
                the first half, with Beecroft final getting the equaliser as half time is called.
                <br/><br/>
                Half time break concludes and play commences. North Ryde kick up a gear and
                playing much more of a strategic game. Players are holding position and making
                it very challenging for the opposition, Beecroft. After several more runs of play
                down the southern side line, Anuj sends home the second of his match goals to put
                North Ryde ahead with eight minutes of play remaining.  Beecroft were not giving
                up and continued to create a more opportunities to square up the score-line.
                However, they did count on the strength of North Ryde’s defence, and more
                importantly their goal keeper who proved to be impenetrable. One minute from
                full-time and Jacob puts the result beyond any doubt. He receives a beautifully
                timed pass and squeezes it in between the goal post, three or four Beecroft
                players and the goal keeper, into the net.
                <br/><br/>
                Final score North Ryde three (3), Beecroft one (1)

                Round 13 was over at River Glade against Thornleigh who we originally had a 1-all
                draw with. This was a hard fought contest against the two teams with both having
                several attempts but neither side getting a goal in the whole match.

                The boys defence was very solid for this game and they were showing real signs of
                a good team with players constantly working with each other and looking for
                passing opportunities to their team mates. Positioning was keeping our defence
                strong and we were unlucky not to land one of our goal attempts and steal the win.
                <br/><br/>
                Another draw to the ever growing tally - but still a very good effort. Riley took
                out the certificate.

                This week’s game was relatively close to home being fielded at Meadowbank at a
                reasonable time of 9.15am against Hills Hawks. Our squad was at near capacity,
                only missing our new recruit to soccer and manager’s son, Joe. It was my duty
                to interpret coach Paul’s substitution list and organise the boys and girl for
                the game. With a beautifully colour coded team sheet and clipboard I took to my
                task with some trepidation but with the full support of the other parents I felt
                that I could survive this task.
                <br/><br/>
                Our team took to the field full of enthusiasm and we dominated play from the
                start but domination means nothing without converting chances into goals. Hills
                Hawks had less of the ball but when they did get it they tried their hardest to
                squeeze the ball past our 1st half keeper but Kan was up to the test and refused
                to let that ball cross his line - he was superb!
                <br/><br/>
                Jarvis, Thomas, Jack and Hugh all did their best up front to get that illusive
                first goal but it just did not want to come. It took our smallest striker,
                Hayley, to correct this situation and right on half time she placed her foot in
                the right spot and our first half domination resulted in a 1-0 scoreline at
                halftime.
                <br/><br/>
                The team commenced the second half full of energy from the oranges and an
                eagerness to go on with the job. Our defence held strong with James, Connor,
                Nat, Andrew and Austin determined to keep the Hawks from coming too close to
                Hugh in goals. Our midfield also joined in on the act with Liam Kan and Michael
                helping to set up the forwards and run back to help in defence.
                <br/><br/>
                As the second half went on we decided a 1-0 lead was not enough and Jarvis, Kan
                and Hayley decided that it was time to add another goal each, much to the
                excitement of the North Ryde supporters. We held on to a 4-0 lead until just
                before the very end when the Hawks were able to sneak a ball through the legs
                of Hugh to score their only goal.
                <br/><br/>
                For this game - special mention to Michael for your well placed corners, Austin
                for your big boot saving us in defence, and Andrew for your constant lack of
                fear to use your head at anytime to head the ball. Man of the match was Nat who
                stood firm in defence and did not let us down.
                <br/><br/>
                Well done team - it was a pleasure to watch you and see how far you have come.
                Congratulations to Paul our coach and Adam our manager for what you have done!
                <br/><br/>

                Following on from last weekend’s great result against West Pennant Hills, it was
                time to back it up against Epping Eastwood who had proved to be tough opposition
                earlier this season. And based on the 1st half, this game was to be no different
                even though they only had 10 players on the day.
                <br/><br/>
                On a beautiful winter’s morning, North Ryde proceeded to dominate the game but
                found the Tigers defence to be on top form - no one more so than the goalkeeper
                who made quite a few good saves in the 1st half.
                <br/><br/>
                Eli was causing a lot of problems for Epping Eastwood with his speed and trickery
                in & around the penalty area. On one great occasion, Eli dribbled through 3 players
                only for the keeper to save the day.
                <br/><br/>
                Just before half time, the Tigers had a great chance in front of goals but
                thankfully the shot went over the bar and the score remained 0-0.
                <br/><br/>
                Any nerves were calmed 2 minutes into the 2nd half. A great ball was played by
                Eli from halfway which Dion expertly controlled and beautifully placed past the
                advancing keeper.
                <br/><br/>
                From here, North Ryde started to boss the game and a great shot by Charlie from
                the edge of the box was saved.
                <br/><br/>
                Around midway of the 2nd half, 2 more goals were scored within a few minutes to
                put us ahead 3-0.
                <br/><br/>
                Sam was able to finish off even though under pressure after the ball had been
                bobbling around in the penalty area.
                <br/><br/>
                Shortly after, Lachlan very coolly converted a rebound into the back of the net
                and the 3 points were in the bag.
                <br/><br/>
                Some great passing & running off the ball was displayed and the defence (+Tim)
                were on top form and kept the opposition scoreless.
                <br/><br/>
                It was another wonderful performance by the team which we hope will continue for
                upcoming matches.

                North Ryde were slow to get going in the first half and had to defend a lot of
                the time. Salim, Robert and Matt had to do a lot of work. In the second half we
                went out with a bit more determination, but North Epping found some gaps too.
                One of our defenders put out his arm in a reflex action, resulting in a penalty.
                The North Epping kick would have been hard to stop for any goal keeper. Zac
                tried to score himself, but didn't quite make it. Adam's great throw-ins helped
                keep us moving forward.
                <br/><br/>
                Finally, Hamish crashed through several defenders into free space and scored
                with a good kick into the corner of the net. Unfortunately, we couldn't find a
                way to score another goal and had to settle for a draw, but it was an improvement
                on our recent losses.

                It was a sunny day at Campbell Park in West Pennants Hills, perfect for a soccer
                match. When the match started we only had nine players, two of which were very
                sick but we were determined to win no matter what.
                <br/><br/>
                During the first half we concentrated on being first to the ball and in doing so
                that gave our forwards and midfielders lots of chances to shoot but we just
                couldn’t score.
                <br/><br/>
                When we came back on for half time we had lifted spirits. Laurence, Luke and Saxon
                passed the ball up the right hand side of the field and when Luke was out in the
                clear Laurence passed and  Luke scored the first goal of the game leaving the
                scores 1-0 our way. West Pennants Hills and Cherrybrook’s FC had a big comeback
                and dominated ball possession most of the time. They put us under enormous
                pressure which got WPH lots of corners. Guillaume (goalie) had a great save. They
                passed the ball in the middle of the goalie box. They finally scored that made
                the score levelled (1-1).
                <br/><br/>
                All of our players ran even harder to cover the field. Lachlan got the ball from
                the opposition and made a brilliant straight pass to Jack who was not marked;
                Jack got the ball and smashed it into back of the net. Nicholas almost scored
                two goals on a corner. Tom and Alvin defended well at the back. The score remained
                2-1 our way till the end of the game. The reason why we didn’t score much was
                because they had a very good goalie.
                <br/><br/>
                Today we had our most significant win in this tournament so far. Everybody put in
                120% effort especially Guillaume (player of the match).

                For the tenth game of the year, with a clear day and an 11:00am start, the boys
                played at Cheltenham Oval at Cheltenham against Beecroft SC, who are currently
                7th in the GHFA competition. Does this field ever have any grass?
                <br/><br/>
                Mitchell was away with a bad back, Lewis had injured his calf muscle the day
                before and could not play, Harry was sick but still turned up to cheer his team
                on! So we had a squad of 12 players.
                <br/><br/>
                They where many highlights, which are below in chronological order:
                <ul class="disc">
                  <li>Tom flicks ball to Daniel, goal shot</li>
                  <li>Nat in goals today</li>
                  <li>Ben switch to Kyle, corner to NRS, Tom takes corner</li>
                  <li>Kyle to Kevin, goalie keeper just clears shot</li>
                  <li>Manav good throw in to Hayden</li>
                  <li>Ben makes a strong header up to Hayden</li>
                  <li>Chris great kick from standing still position and clears the ball away</li>
                  <li>Daniel head to Tom, to Hayden (nice move)</li>
                  <li>Ben kicks ball into goal box, Kevin lets it through, goal keeper clears</li>
                  <li>Tom corner to Hayden, shoot cleared</li>
                  <li>Nat strong run out to get ball</li>
                  <li>Cameron strong, long throw in!</li>
                  <li>Alex takes header off goal kick, strong header!</li>
                  <li>Tom (LHS) cross, Goalie drops the ball, Kevin kicks it in. 1-0</li>
                  <li>Tom kicks the ball back to Hayden, nice kick but edged wide. NRS corner</li>
                  <li>Ben takes corner, Daniel header just wide of the goal.</li>
                  <li>Cameron kicks ball across goal, Kevin almost got there!</li>
                  <li>Manav chase the ball to goal keeper, pressure on goalie who drops ball out, corner to NRS taken by Ben</li>
                  <li>Tom excellent late cross, Kevin lines it up but just misses</li>
                  <li>Alex big left foot clear</li>
                </ul>
                Half Time, to this point of the game it looked like NRS was in charge, can we
                continue this pressure? Paul advises the boys to be more aware of the bouncy
                field and keep up the pressure!
                <br/><br/>
                Then:
                <ul class="disc">
                  <li>Beecroft nice cross into our goal box, cleared to attacker in front of the goal box. Excellent big kick and goal to Beecroft. 1-1</li>
                  <li>Tom cross, goalie drops it, Daniel shoots just wide</li>
                  <li>Daniel flicks the ball up and over, Kevin put pressure on Goalie</li>
                  <li>Free kick to Beecroft just outside our goal box, Nat knocks the ball forward and out of the Goal box, stopped Beecroft from taking the lead.</li>
                  <li>Chris runs and dribbles the full length of the field and shoots, just wide.</li>
                  <li>Cameron, free kick to goal keeper but good kick</li>
                  <li>Tom pushes through passes to Daniel, waits then passes the goal keeper. 2-1</li>
                  <li>LHS side move, Alex big pass to Tom, defender down, goal kick to goal keeper</li>
                  <li>Manav asserts himself, puts pressure on Beecroft back which forces him to kick it out.</li>
                  <li>Luke was pushing his weight around and making the Beecroft attackers work hard, great and sustained effort for the whole game!</li>
                  <li>Beecroft no 2 pushes Daniel out of the way, free kick</li>
                  <li>Cameron takes free kick, wide</li>
                  <li>Chris covers the whole field again with one of his typical runs, gets a corner for his efforts</li>
                  <li>Referee blows the whistle</li>
                </ul>
                Lewis presented Manav with his belated cup cake for last week player of the match.
                The player of the match this week was Nat, well deserved after his goal and match
                winning save!
                <br/><br/>
                I would like to thank all the parents who came to support our team... you do make a loud difference!
