                This was an interesting week for the U6 Green team, there were no reserves and
                "The wall" of the team kept their undefeated status through skill and
                determination. The game started with our team appearing to be distracted by...
                well... everything... except for the game that they were playing!
                <br/><br/>
                It was the Ravens B team who opened the scoring with a well received own goal
                then they scored a goal leading to 1-1. The tension mounted and Christian and
                Will scored a goal before half time.
                <br/><br/>
                The oranges must have given the team the push along that they needed and following
                the Break Will Scored and amazing 2 goals withing 30 seconds of each other.
                Christian and Blake also scored in the second half. The mud was flying and
                everyone came off ready for the napisan bucket.
                <br/><br/>
                Special mention to Will Harrison for his incredible skills from start to finish
                in attack and defense that lead the team to victory. Well done to Will being the
                player of the match.

                Not a great turnout in the final weekend of school holidays. With 2 Macquarie
                players, and 3 of our team appearing by match start time. Later Macquarie were
                able to field 3 players and a 3 on 3 game could start. They eventually even had
                4, so were able to rotate.
                <br/><br/>
                Our boys Liam, Cameron and Ethan had to work hard in this game, with no chance
                of a break. Some near misses in the first half, and Macquarie had a skilled
                little player able to dribble well, keeping our boys on their toes, and he scored
                a few goals. Cameron and Liam made some exciting clearances from the goal line,
                and Ethan had some good long range shots, none quite on target though.
                <br/><br/>
                The boys learned some good lessons today about staying up with the ball, and
                kicking into space. Player of the match was Cameron.
                <br/><br/>
                Special thanks to Rich (Cameron's Dad) for filling in as coach.

                This week the team was playing away against Gladesville Ravens on a field where
                there was more mud to be seen than grass but this was not going to deter the boys
                determination and enthusiasm. After a week off to recharge their batteries it was
                clear from the start that the boys meant business with Ben kicking off proceedings
                with a goal in the fifth minute. The Ravens quickly retaliated with a goal of
                their own only a few minutes later. Only a couple of minutes after that, Ben had
                another shot at goals and secured our second goal of the game taking us into the
                half time break 2-1 up.
                <br/><br/>
                Going into the second half, the boys did their best to maintain their lead,
                however the Ravens made a clear break to score in the fifth minute. After a number
                of opportunities at goal by both sides for the remainder of the game, the game
                ended with a 2-2 draw.
                <br/><br/>
                After some great defensive game play by the boys, with one player down as well,
                overall it was a very tight game against an evenly matched opposition. The team
                should be really proud of themselves this week given that previously the Ravens
                won 4-2 which goes to show how much the team has improved since the last encounter.
                In light of this, player of the match went to the entire team this week.

                What a fantastic game! Gladesville were short at the start so we shared a player
                so that we could kick off.
                <br/><br/>
                North Ryde displayed great sportsmanship and team work. The final score was 3-0

                The school holidays have been fun for all, although we were concerned when we were
                not sure if we had enough players to start the game on Saturday. Needless to say
                the U8 Brown team took this in there stride and were excited to take the field.
                <br/><br/>
                Special mention goes to Christian Robson from the U6 green team who stepped up and
                played his second game of the day with no reserves and matched the U8 level for
                skill and endurance throughout the game.
                <br/><br/>
                The game opened with 2 well matched teams and it was Luca who made an impressive
                run down the field and took a shot from well outside the circle to score a
                brilliant hard hitting goal under the cross bar, as you can imagine the crowd
                were elated. The Glenhaven team returned the favour with an equalizing goal.
                Tension mounted and Luca decided it was time to show everyone that he could
                follow-up with another amazing shot from well out of the circle putting the team
                back in the lead. The U8 brown team was so focused at half time, that they didn't
                eat their oranges and barely had a drink as they wanted to get back on the field
                and keep playing. Something happened on that field on Saturday as every player
                stepped it up and played to the best of their abilities with positional play, ball
                skills, passing, defending and determination and no one had a break. Brooklyn
                scored another 2 goals and Ben scored a goal with the final score 5-1.
                <br/><br/>
                Well done to all, what a great result. Player of the week this week went to Ben
                for his strength and determination on the field and excellent throw-ins.

                Round 3 (rescheduled wet game) against Glenhaven was on last week. Unfortunately
                I could not attend the game so this report is second hand. The boys played a
                tight first half which kept the scores at nil all.
                <br/><br/>
                Into the second half Glenhaven scored a lucky goal that slipped through our
                keeper's hands. Luke pushed up from defence and managed to get an equaliser,
                with Darcy clinching a winning goal towards the end to give the boys a 2-1 win.
                Really sorry I missed it.

                North Ryde's tussle with Kenthurst this morning was a good contest, close and
                tight, and you would have been hard-pressed to make a wager on the eventual
                outcome of the game with any degree of confidence prior to the final whistle.
                <br/><br/>
                The game started off well, and our one-touch passing and positional awareness
                between the defence, midfield and forwards improves with each passing week.
                A clean and swift movement down the left wing just five minutes into the game
                gave Lachlan the time and space to wind up a scorcher with his left boot over
                <img class="noborder imgleft" src="images/photos/u11/20110716_u11_div1_3.jpg">
                <img class="noborder imgleft" src="images/photos/u11/20110716_u11_div1_4.jpg">
                several heads, including the goal-keeper's, into the top-right corner of the
                nets. It was an excellent start to the match and served to reduce the initial
                pressure and help settle the nerves, but we could not have foreseen the speed
                and voracity with which the Kenthurst team came back at us.
                <br/><br/>
                They struck three times and in quick succession. The first came from a ball that
                rebounded unfortunately off Tim's initial save, and only required a knee-in to
                finish it off. The second was an unstoppable direct penalty that was well struck
                into the low right-hand corner, and the third came after a zippy run by the
                Kenthurst left midfielder whose low and timely cross was easily converted. We were
                three goals to one down by the middle of the first half and it didn't seem like we
                could do much to stem the rort. But North Ryde came back, to their immense credit,
                shaking off the demoralising splurge of Kenthurst goals and sticking to their game
                plan. The defence held firm and the midfield re-captured their possession of the
                ball, setting up numerous opportunities for the strikers, two of which were ably
                converted by Eli to draw level at three goals apiece at the break.
                <br/><br/>

                The game see-sawed throughout the second half but neither side were able to
                add any further points to the scoreboard. We appeared to have the lion's share
                of possession and opportunities in the second half, as is often the case, and
                without taking any credit away from the Kenthurst team who were playing their
                socks off as well, it is fair to say that we received no favours from the referee
                who was widely regarded as their '12th player' in post-match analysis and
                discussions. No more so than in the final minute of play, when Oscar P broke
                through the Kenthurst defence to intercept a through-ball, with just the keeper
                to beat, only to be ruled off-side by what surely would have been the match
                winner. Them's the breaks, no third umpires here. Even the Kenthurst coach
                conceded that our attacker had not been offside, but was clearly relieved, as
                we were, to settle for a draw between two good and evenly-matched sides.
                <br/><br/>
                Well done North Ryde, an excellent come-back and recovery when the chips were
                down.

                It was good to come away with a win from a hard fought game. As has often been
                the case, North Ryde took a while to start working as a team. However, we kept
                Kenthurst out, unlike our last meeting.
                <br/><br/>
                Robert was again good in defence. Hamish had a shot that went wide and then Luke
                poked in his first goal of the season from a pass across the goal mouth. It was
                a good reward for Luke’s efforts forward and in mid-field.
                <br/><br/>
                In the second half North Ryde played well. Zac and Massie peppered the goal, but
                were just off target. Matt and Thomas worked hard in defence. Finally, Benyad was
                in the right place at the right time and put away his first goal for the year.
                A great finish to a good team performance.

                The grey drizzle did not deter North Ryde, nor did the prospect of facing the top
                of the division Redbacks who had previously beaten us 4-0. Captained by last week's
                player's player of the match, Tom, North Ryde boasted an almost full complement of
                players with the luxury of 2 reserves.
                <br/><br/>
                North Ryde got into the game fairly quickly and proceeded to dominate the play.
                They were rewarded after around 15 minutes when after a series of accurate passes,
                the ball found its way to Guillaume who deservedly scored the opening goal. The
                Redbacks turned on the pressure and enjoyed a series of attacks arising from
                intercepted goal kicks. North Ryde did well to hold on and prior to half time
                again enjoyed some dominance.
                <br/><br/>
                The second half began with an onslaught from the Redbacks which saw them score an
                equaliser after around 6 minutes. After their goal the Redbacks seemed to come
                alive and North Ryde spent most of the remaining match solidly defending. One
                minute from the end goalie Tom made an excellent save at the feet of an oncoming
                striker thereby thwarting the Redbacks effort to clinch victory at the end.
                <br/><br/>
                All in all this was a tremendous result for North Ryde, holding the division
                leaders to a 1-1 draw. Special mention must go to Harrison who made his return
                to the field after a 7 week absence due to a broken arm. In spite of suffering
                from an injured right foot, Harrison insisted he play today and as such did a
                great job in defence forced to use his left foot.
                <br/><br/>
                Harrison's performance earned him a well deserved manager's player of the match
                award.
                <br/><br/>
                Great performance North Ryde. As coach Terry said: "Play like today for the last
                two matches and you'll surely win." Keep it up!!!

                For the twelfth game of the year, with a clear day and an 11:00am start, the boys
                played at North Ryde Oval against Glenhaven SC, who is currently 7th in the GHFA
                competition but they were pumped up after there victory against Redfield Lions,
                who were leading the competition, the week before. We had a squad of 13 players
                with Kevin and Hayden away.
                <br/><br/>
                As I was running the line therefore I have a short report today:
                <ul class="disc">
                  <li>Lewis was In Goals</li>
                  <li>We started strongly and soon Daniel placed a goal 1-0</li>
                  <li>We were dominating the game but at one point just could not mark Glenhaven LHS striker close enough as he made a pass right on the line, next to the goal, who completed his pass to another striker who headed it in, there was nothing Lewis could do. 1-1</li>
                  <li>Glenhaven were pumped, their parents were excited as well.</li>
                </ul>
                Half Time, to this point of the game it look even, NRS had more attacks and
                possession but the score was 1-1. Paul advises the boys to try to be lift their
                game and intensity. Then:
                <ul class="disc">
                  <li>Nat was in goals</li>
                  <li>The boys lifted the intensity</li>
                  <li>Daniel scored again with a header 2-1</li>
                  <li>I yelled to Tom pass to Cameron, who was clear, and he did. Cameron did his cork screw kick. 3-1</li>
                  <li>Ben, off a corner, nails the ball with a header. 4-1</li>
                  <li>In the dying minute the Glenhaven striker unmarked and just inside the half way mark made a high lob just out of reach for Nat and scored. 4-2</li>
                </ul>
                The whole team put in a great effort:
                <ul class="disc">
                  <li>Chris with his strong runs and often standing still clearing kicks</li>
                  <li>Alex with his clearing and strong headers.</li>
                  <li>Luke who’s throw ins are amazing, the work at the gym is paying off.</li>
                  <li>Mitchell showing his skill with the ball.</li>
                  <li>Kyle aggressive runs and passes up the RHS.</li>
                  <li>Tom still showing a clean pair of heals up the LHS</li>
                  <li>Manav, many attempts at goal shots. I am sure he will get one.</li>
                  <li>Harry, looking more confident</li>
                </ul>
                Rata presented Daniel with the player of the match and cup cake, well done Daniel.
                <br/><br/>
                I would like to thank all the parents who came to support our team... you do make
                a difference!
