                Good control of the ball up front saw Riley score within the first few
                minutes. Riley took the ball well up the field many times, breaking through
                the defence with persistent dribbling. He was unlucky not to score more than
                once.
                <br/><br/>
                Dimitri took the field reluctantly due to the cold, but was able to block
                the opposition several times. His persistence and defence earned him the
                player of the week award. Spyridon bravely took the field even though a knee
                injury had reduced his speed to a hobble, and he was able to provide some
                good defence and kick-ins closer to our goal.
                <br/><br/>
                William got right involved in the defence and attack sides of the game,
                playing mostly in the mid-field and clearing the ball for his team. Ben was
                active in defence, making one save with a last minute tackle right in front
                of the goal, and just missing out on scoring a goal himself.
                <br/><br/>
                It was a good game, hard fought by both sides. Each team is still learning
                to keep their hands to themselves, with a bit of shoving and holding going
                on, but this was because both sides were keen to score, with no harm intended.

                Fatigue has finally set in. Well that's our excuse and we're sticking to
                it! It's been a long season and our guys were outplayed by a very committed
                opponent last weekend. As usual, they never gave up and were chasing as hard
                at the end of the game as they were from the start.
                <br/><br/>
                Rather than harp on the negatives and what went wrong I thought I might take
                this opportunity to write about all of our players individually and their
                season.
                <br/><br/>
                <span class="bold">Jarvis</span> - a better competitor you will never meet.
                Jarvis has been week in, week out one of our most consistent players. If
                he's not scoring a mountain of goals he's saving them at the other end of
                the field. Bigger and better things lie ahead.
                <br/><br/>
                <span class="bold">Charlie</span> - in a word, brilliant! He scored SIX
                goals in one game and plenty more throughout the season. His combination
                with Jarvis with the long kicks has been a highlight all season. Charlie
                is very speedy and skillful with the ball at his feet. (I guess it helps
                when your dad is the boss of Sportskickstart!)
                <br/><br/>
                <span class="bold">James</span> - our biggest improver! If we drew a line
                at the start of the year and measured it at the end in terms of development
                and application, James would be a clear winner. James has been quite
                outstanding for the last three or four games... it's almost a shame the
                season is drawing to an end.
                <br/><br/>
                <span class="bold">Lioda</span> - our petal amongst the thorns. It would
                have been easy for Lioda to just sit back and let the boys get involved in
                the tough stuff each week but Lioda more than matched her opponents quite
                regularly. We're very hopeful to have Lioda running around again with us
                in the U8's next season.
                <br/><br/>
                <span class="bold">Jaiden</span> - or should I call him Ronaldo! There's not
                a lot of him but he can certainly play. Jaiden was our little magician who
                had a new trick for us every week. The good thing was he knew when to produce
                it. Apart from his skill, he's a tough little bugger too... plenty of knocks
                but always got back out there.
                <br/><br/>
                <span class="bold">Jack</span> - my encouragement award winner (if we had
                such an award that is). Whilst every team has their one or two 'stars', Jack
                doesn't pretend to be one of those, but what he gave us, or what I saw was
                someone who was really determined to win the ball at times and when coming
                away empty handed was a little deflated. I am convinced that Jack can and
                will be one of those future 'stars' and would love to see him back next year
                (right Lisa?).
                <br/><br/>
                <span class="bold">Daniel</span> - (this is an unbiased view). What a
                champion of the future... where are the talent scouts? (sorry, that's
                the father talking out of the way). From the little bloke I saw running
                around in the U6's last year to what he's been able to do this year in
                particular the enjoyment he's got from playing with this team, he's made
                me very proud.
                <br/><br/>
                One more to go!

                The Blues found themselves in the far-flung outskirts of the Sydney
                metropolis as they faced the Hills Hawks on a fresh and early Saturday
                morning in Galston. The chilly weather did little to dampen their
                spirits though and they applied themselves to their task as soon as
                the whistle blew, tearing into their opposition with trademark speed
                and passion.
                <br/><br/>
                The Hawks were on the back foot from the word go as the Blues went on a
                hungry and relentless hunt of the opposition goal line, turning in several
                shots at goal that either just missed or were well saved by the keeper.
                But the sustained pressure eventually took its toll on the Hawks defence
                and a charged Blues attack finally ended with a terrific goal off Eli's
                boot into the back of the net.
                <br/><br/>
                In a game that saw every Blues player giving it their maximum and working
                superbly as a team, it isn't quite fair to single out any one player for
                special mention. But it is also hard to ignore the three goals that came
                off Adam's boot today that were nothing short of phenomenal. All three came
                from exceptional corner kicks, none of which touched a Blues player before
                going into the nets. The first one came late in the first half, and from
                my vantage point as referee on the field I could tell that it was going
                to be interesting. The ball flew with a terrific trajectory to twice the
                height of the goals, imparted with enough right-to-left spin to guide it
                into the goalmouth, skirt the crossbar, nick the far right post and drop
                behind the goal line before the goalkeeper had a chance to gather it up.
                <br/><br/>

                There was a rather deafening silence that followed this goal as everyone
                tried to work out what had happened, including the Hawks coach who had been
                annoyingly vociferous until then. All except Adam, that is, who was already
                scampering back to his half to restart the game. But that isn't where it
                ended. He went on to do the exact same thing on two more occasions after
                the break to effectively take all the stuffing out of the Hawks resolve
                and completely mute the enthusiasm of the entourage of Hawks fans on the
                sideline. Magic.&nbsp;

                The Blues weren't done yet, of course, and as long as there were minutes
                left on the clock they were going continue their game with the same pace
                and fury until the ref told them to stop. The pattern became familiar;
                rock-solid defence and nifty footwork began each movement, slick passing
                and dribbling in the midfield accompanied by some fluid runs down the
                sideline, and more often than not ending with an opportunity on goal.
                The Blues final goal was scored in much the same way as the first, with
                Eli once again adding the finishing touch to close the Blues account for
                the day at five well-deserved goals to nil.
                <br/><br/>
                The talking point after the match was all about the extent to which the
                Blues, in their own time and on their own terms, have learnt to read the
                game and anticipate the type of game play they need to assemble to get
                the show on the road. Their passing is more frequent and accurate now,
                and they are able to move the ball very quickly across the park. Their
                positioning without the ball is on song and there always seems to be a
                blue and gold strip in the right place and at the right time. And the
                defence speaks for itself. At one point the Hawks broke through a gap
                and had 4 or 5 players storming with the ball towards the goals, only
                to be overtaken a few seconds later by a swarm of blue shirts bent on
                protecting their goals as though their lives depended on it.
                <br/><br/>
                It was a real treat to watch the Blues in action today, and share in the
                passion with which they play their game.
                <br/><br/>
                Well done Blues&nbsp;

                Well, after our training was washed out during the week, the weather came
                good for us and we were able to get a game in this weekend at Kenthurst.
                <br/><br/>
                We started with the wind firmly in our faces as we kicked off.
                <br/><br/>
                Straight away, Kenthurst made an early attack and failed at a shot at our
                goal and almost immediately followed up with another failed attempt, this
                time sailing clear over the top. Kenthurst's relentless attack would continue
                throughout much of the game. They made a third attempt at goal when Thomas
                appeared from nowhere diverting the ball across the goal face which was mere
                millimetres from scoring.
                <br/><br/>
                <img class="imgtopleft noborder"
                src="images/photos/u8/20080802_u8_green_2.jpg">
                The game was set to become hard fought and quite entertaining as our team
                proved to be equally relentless in their defence as our opposition was in
                their attack.
                <br/><br/>
                Kenthurst scored their only first half goal 4 minutes in.
                <br/><br/>
                Quick thinking from Matthew & Thomas saw us quickly hit back with Matt taking
                a failed shot at their goal after 6 minutes. Rhea got some good breaks up
                front but was frustratingly shut down by a surprisingly quick player from
                Kenthurst on more than one occasion.
                <br/><br/>
                The 2nd half was much of the same with some excitement coming from Rhea,
                Matt & Oscar moving the ball into position with Rhea taking a shot under
                enormous pressure from Kenthurst causing her to just miss the goal.
                <br/><br/>
                <img class="imgtopleft noborder"
                src="images/photos/u8/20080802_u8_green_3.jpg">
                Both our goalkeepers, Liam in the first half and Hamish in the second half
                did extremely well given the relentless pressure they were under ceding only
                one goal each. Hamish in particular took an absolute thumping on more than
                one occasion from some hard kicked balls from the opposition but consistently
                held his ground.
                <br/><br/>
                Peter managed a few good kicks, booting the ball back over the line into
                Kenthurst's half a number of times. There were some of Sams usual 'quick
                response' breaks and some great defence from Thomas, Andrhea and Satya in
                the first half and Peter, Ryan and Mitchell in the second half helping this
                great team effort to curb the strength of Kenthurst.
                <br/><br/>
                At the end when the dust settled, it was 2-0 to Kenthurst, one in each half,
                but a hard fought 2 points they were and our team can hold their heads high
                with their effort.
                <br/><br/>
                Congratulations to both Thomas and Hamish for this weeks Player Awards for
                their gutsy effort.

                The penultimate game! The memories of this cosy ground are only happy. Not
                only is it a lovely short drive into the country, but the stroll through the
                scenic grounds not to mention the great play area and well equipped canteen,

                The first half was a bit weird, with the opposing ref only playing 15 minutes.

                <span class="bold">Brooke</span> tasted that wonderful feeling in scoring her

                stoutly making the going tough for the boys and girls in red, white & black.
                <br/><br/>
                <span class="bold">Josh</span> and <span class="bold">Tim</span> were also
                standouts in defence getting in with some terrific boots n all tackles.

                <span class="bold">Maggie</span> did her usual trick in terrifying their
                defence (see the photo of her hassling the Redfields guy) while

                ball cleared.
                <br/><br/>
                The second half was a tad longer, but not long enough! Redfield scored the
                winning goal and the ref blew full time immediately. Supporters of North Ryde
                were very sporting and did not blow up, instead congratulated one and all for
                a top effort. <span class="bold">Harrison</span> played out of his boots (so

                What did we learn from today? - hmmm, well perhaps to remember to buy the
                ref a new stop watch or even to lobby the association to not allow future
                international under-age players to play up an age group or two, (they had
                at least one 5 year old!)
                <br/><br/>
                But perhaps the most important thing is to remember to have fun which is

                North Ryde 10/1's last game of the season - play off with STU for the pennant.
                <br/><br/>
                The game started well for NRS which managed to keep the ball in the STU
                half and looking threatening for an early goal but STU defence proved too
                sharp and it was not long before STU had the ball down NRS end putting a
                lot of pressure on our defence.
                <br/><br/>
                Several shots at goal were made by STU and our defenders and goalkeeper Josh
                were great in persistently repelling it. Josh did another magnificent job in
                goals after putting his body on the line - very much the gutsy goalie. It was
                not until the last couple of minutes of first half that STU took the score to
                1 - 0 with a great angled shot into the corner of the goal.
                <br/><br/>
                Once again, NRS made the first charge for goal in the beginning of the 2nd
                half but to no avail, only to have STU get the ball down to the other end of
                the field so quickly that our defenders were struggling and by the 2nd minute
                STU had made it 2-0 which remained the final result.
                <br/><br/>
                Overall NRS put in a reasonably good performance considering Emile had an
                ankle injury, James had a touch of the flu and until Shannon and Eli turned
                up to help for the 2nd half (U8's), NRS had no reserves.
                <br/><br/>
                Man of the match was awarded to Aymon for his overall solid performance
                - this is despite having to play in his siblings boots, which were at least
                two sizes too big.

                It was a clear morning with a cool strong westerly breeze that brushed up
                the backs of the Nitros as they prepared for a battle of attrition against
                the number 2 team of the competition.
                <br/><br/>
                Clearly, the boys were recovering from a late night of partying with a slow
                and defensive start that saw the opening play favouring the Rovers.
                Fortunately, the backs were holding strong with great clearances by Chris
                and James and dogged pressure from Nathan. After about fifteen minutes,
                however, the sleepies were shaken and the remainder of the first half became
                an even affair with some great opportunities created by blistering runs down
                the wings by Zac and Kyle and a strong show by Aman through the centre. With
                the wind still bearing on the field the passes were not always as clean as
                they could have been but some uncompromising driving through the opposition
                by Hayden and Ben did result in chances for Luke. By half time, the result
                was still nil all thanks to a number of confident saves by Lachlan when our
                defences were occasionally penetrated.
                <br/><br/>
                At half time, the Nitros realised they still had some hard work ahead and
                glances over to the opposition huddle proved the Rovers were trying to come
                up with a new strategy. With timely advice from the coach, the Nitros
                reentered the field of play for the second half with new knowledge and
                confidence. This half showed a different side of the Nitros. More confident
                passing and use of the space available on the field meant a domination of
                the possession. A few through-balls from the center by Elia and unrelenting
                attacking by Thomas increased the chances for the forwards. Thus most of the
                second half was played in the opposition's half with cracks in the Rovers'
                defence bringing opportunities for corner kicks by Cameron's big boot. One
                blistering run by Luke gave a solo opportunity that could not be converted
                but was looking to be the play of the match until Cameron took a clean clear
                swipe at the ball that found the back of the net with less than five minutes
                remaining. The game was not over yet and the Rovers attempted a late rally
                but as the clock ticked towards the final whistle it was clear that the
                Nitros were going to maintain control and come away with the win.
