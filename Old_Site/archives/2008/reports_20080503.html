                The Under 6A's Green Machine played Holy Cross at Holy Cross. Due to Holy
                Cross having only three players, Elliot Cunningham played for the other team
                so as not to forfeit the game. It was a very close game. Chris was alive
                taking the ball down the side line and scoring our three goals. Gus was a
                great defender, doing a back pass and getting the ball away from our goal.
                Cooper and Zac were distributing the ball well. It was in the last 30 seconds
                of the game that Holy cross scored the winner. Player of the match was

                You could tell just by the kind of day we had woken up to that it was going
                to be a special day. Our U7 Green Koalas were just simply awesome and
                inspiring! Not only did they have to contend with only having four players
                show up (1 short) and their opposition having a few reserves, so fresh legs,
                but they also had a new coach for the day at the last minute (the author).
                So it seemed that anything that could go wrong did go wrong.
                <br/><br/>
                The only instruction given to the team by their coach before kick-off was
                to just have fun. After only a few minutes, we had gone a couple of goals
                behind and under normal circumstances you would expect to see some long
                faces and perhaps a drop in enthusiasm... not for this great bunch of kids!
                Led by Jarvis who was his usual workhorse self all over the park (makes me
                tired just watching him), the Koalas started to work their way back into
                the game against a lot fresher opponents. Before you knew it the Koalas
                had drawn level, with Daniel scoring his first ever goal (lucky his father
                wasn't refereeing at the time or he might have made a goose of himself by
                jumping 10ft in the air). James was brilliant as well keeping his opponents
                at bay with solid defence and also starting up a number of attacking raids
                of his own. Our Player of The Match, Lioda, was sensational. Lioda was
                involved in everything and it didn't matter how physical it got, she didn't
                back off one bit.
                <br/><br/>
                I wasn't concerned (and never am) with how many times the ball goes into the
                back of the net. The determination shown by Jarvis, Daniel, Lioda and James,
                whilst being pretty tired and never giving up, made them all winners. The
                <span class="bold">Fab Four</span> should be proud of themselves.
                <br/><br/>
                Special mentions to Will who helped out for around the last 10 minutes after
                playing his own U6 game earlier, to the coach and manager from Hunters Hill,
                who have their team playing in a wonderful spirit and especially to the
                parents and supporters from both teams who were very fair in their
                encouragement of both teams.
                <br/><br/>
                Thank you to all concerned.

                It was another brilliant morning for just about anything and the Under 8
                Blues once again hurled themselves onto the field with the only kind of
                non-stop enthusiasm they understand. The whistle blew and a sudden mass of
                young bodies jostled for possession of the ball with the usual shark-feeding
                frenzy that is common in the initial minutes of any match. It was soon evident
                that both teams were evenly matched and the spectators were going to be treated
                to a good game of football.
                <br/><br/>
                Both North Ryde and West Pennant Hills were commendable in the way they moved
                the ball up the field with plenty of dynamic kicks and quality passes, matched
                only by the excellent and solid defensive tackles that were applied in equal
                measure as they sought to defend their respective goal areas.
                <span class="bold">Shannon</span> was a work-horse during his first-half spell
                in goals, diving at the feet of his would-be attacker to relieve him of the
                ball and keep the scoreline in check.
                <br/><br/>
                The break came about five minutes into the first half when WPH somehow got
                the ball past a mass of players crowding the Blue's goal to open their account
                at 1-nil. But the Blues struck back hard with some excellent passing play and
                scored two superb goals before the break, one a long-range and well-directed
                kick from <span class="bold">Adam's</span> reliable boot, and the second from
                <span class="bold">David</span> who took advantage of a rebounding ball and
                slammed it into the top corner of the WPH net.
                <br/><br/>
                These two goals were the final product of several well-orchestrated moves that
                involved the entire team. <span class="bold">Tom H</span> again showed us
                how to stay cool in the face of adversity and WPH were always going to
                struggle to move the ball past him. <span class="bold">Christopher</span> and
                <span class="bold">Tom O</span> seemed to occupy similar positions in the
                mid-field and kept the opposition in check with some decisive tackles and
                good forward passes. <span class="bold">Charlie</span>,
                <span class="bold">Eli</span> and <span class="bold">Jack</span> once again
                displayed their useful foot skills to open up some gaps in the play and create
                the scoring opportunities that followed. A terrific effort all round, and the
                Blues walked off at half time 2-1 up against their WPH rivals.
                <br/><br/>
                The second half was a different story though. Shannon was obliged to leave
                at the break and the team was one player short for the remainder of the game.
                Undaunted, the Blues set about their task with the same gusto that they did
                in the first half, but fatigue eventually took it's toll and the Blues were
                doing it tough in the last 10 minutes of the game. WPH, by contrast, had 14
                pairs of legs to choose from and applied substitutions at regular intervals
                during the second half which, combined with a few curiously big players,
                finally gave them the edge to score a further two unanswered goals and win
                the match 3-2.
                <br/><br/>
                The Blues however can be proud of the good account they gave of themselves
                on the field and the manner in which they put everything they could into the
                game. As ref I was particularly impressed with their mature attitude during
                the game, not dishing out unwanted reprimands when a fellow team mate spilt
                the ball and unfazed when a goal was scored against them. The same attitude
                which allows them to have fun out there and bring them back next week for
                some more&nbsp;

                Well done Blues, and well done to <span class="bold">Eli</span> who claimed
                Player of the Match for his consistent effort both in the goals and on the
                field.

                The skies were blue, but there was certainly a winter chill in the air.
                We were keen to get back into it after a wet / holiday break.
                <br/><br/>
                For the first five minutes, the ball never left our half. Beecroft went on
                raid after raid, but our back three of <span class="bold">Ben</span>,
                <span class="bold">Thomas</span> and <span class="bold">Kireth</span> stood
                firm. If it wasn't for them, the score would have been much more than the
                3-0 half time score. <span class="bold">Julian</span> had some great
                practice at taking some very long goal kicks - when he set them up, everyone
                scattered!
                <br/><br/>
                After her heroic spell in goals, <span class="bold">Maggie</span> was as
                busy as ever doing some lovely runs and always looking to pass the ball.
                <span class="bold">Timmy</span> and <span class="bold">Harrison</span>
                did a good job at getting the ball forward in the second half and second-half
                goalie <span class="bold">Thomas</span> did a great job in lobbing
                some long clearances. We almost scored a couple of goals in the second half
                which would have made the score look a lot better - but as we only had nine
                we ran out of puff towards the end.
                <br/><br/>
                <span class="bold">Taylor</span> continues to impress with her 'get in and
                have a go' attitude and <span class="bold">Brooke</span> tried hard all day
                and never gave up and her player of the match was well deserved!
                <br/><br/>
                Nevertheless all the players are learning <span class="italic">fast</span>.
                They are all getting used to playing positions, trying very hard to pass the
                ball and are listening well at training. Most of all they are enjoying their
                Saturday mornings out.

                The boys looked good in their new strip. Going into the game, North Ryde
                appeared to stand a reasonable chance of a win or at least deliver a tightly
                contested match. Hills Hawks only had 10 players, but alas 2 minutes into the
                game they scored their first goal. North Ryde made a couple of attempts at
                goal, the first with a pass from Frazer to Tom and then to Aymon but they
                were unable to convert. The second attempt was a pass from Tom to Emile and
                then to Aymon. At half-time we were 2-nil down. In the second half, North Ryde
                lost sight of trying to turn the score around and perhaps we can attribute the
                final score of 8-nil to the lack of training and cancellation of soccer due to
                the wet weather. Both the coach and president of the club critiqued the game,
                and hopefully the team will take the comments on board and work hard in the
                coming weeks to improve their performance. Player of the match went to Isaac.

                Some say he never smiles or shows compassion. Others report seeing him
                knocking young children to the ground just so he can get to the soccer
                ball first during friendly backyard games. But we at North Ryde Soccer
                just know him as the AXE.
                <br/><br/>
                That's right, the AXE was in charge of our young, innocent girls. Would
                he push the <span class="wildcats">Wildcatz</span> past their physiological
                or psychological limits? Or would he control his all consuming passion to
                win at all costs? Yes, the AXE had jumped at the opportunity to be the
                fill-in coach. Tess, our master coach - the coach of all coaches - was off
                playing her own soccer match. Tess doesn't brag about her sporting
                achievements, but in her game the previous week she scored a hatrick! Not
                bad for a coach! Let's hope all our girls can emulate Tess's achievements
                as the season progresses.
                <br/><br/>
                With both Stefanie and little Emma unavailable (I hope they have Doctor's
                certificates or Stat. Decs), we may have struggled if it wasn't for our new
                recruit Sophie. Let me tell you she has one of the most wicked left foot
                kicks I've seen for an under 12 girl, but more about that later. I'll have
                a contract available prior to training next week.
                <br/><br/>
                Like all good coaches, the AXE had a plan. The only problem was Bhenita
                arrived a little later than the other girls so she was quickly nominated
                as 1st half goalie. So much for the plan!
                <br/><br/>
                There had been a bit of discussion between AXE and the coaching entourage
                regarding the best approach for maintaining our position on the competition
                ladder. Unfortunately nobody had passed that on to the girls. So with the
                kick off being ours, it was a short pass from Jemma to Mia. Then Mia was
                off like a bullet, down the field past 6 defenders to just miss the goal by
                millimetres. This all happened in about 10 seconds! A quick mental calculation
                and at this rate the final score could end up about 200-nil. AXE! AXE! We
                only want to win by 1 - 2 goals max!
                <br/><br/>
                With attack after attack on Beecroft's goal something had to finally give.
                Jemma positioned the ball for her 2nd or 3rd corner kick when the AXE called
                out to Sophie "stay on the goalie!" Apparently it was some tactical play they
                had developed during the summer training months. Hold on... Sophie had just
                joined us. Anyway, Jemma's kick was right on target and Sophie gently pushed
                the ball in.
                <br/><br/>
                Meanwhile, Bhenita in goals was starting to suffer from eye strain due to all
                the play being 100 metres down the field. I don't think she even touched the
                ball during the first half. This wasn't because Beecroft hadn't tried, but
                just the task of getting the ball past our midfielders and backs was
                impossible.
                <br/><br/>
                Half time with a quick rev up by the AXE and a change of goalies, we were
                back into it. Gaelyn very kindly volunteered to help out as goalie and lucky
                she did. It was as if Beecroft had been listening to the AXE's pep talk,
                because they finally were able to get out of their own half twice using our
                tactics; only to be stopped by Gaelyn's great keeping skills.  With what
                seemed like a continuous bombardment of Beecroft's goal mouth, the girls
                showed both incredible individual and team skills. Rokayah was rewarded for
                her efforts with 2 beautiful goals (Mohammad were you watching?). They were
                by no means easy goals but again it just showed the depth of talent within
                the team. In 3 games the <span class="wildcats">Wildcatz</span> have scored
                10 goals by 5 different players and there are plenty more goals to be scored,
                whether it is your first or your tenth before the season finishes.
                <br/><br/>
                This week's Captain, Stella, was controlling her team like a seasoned
                campaigner. Stella started in the back line but as soon as she moved to the
                midfield position, her desire to score goals was ignited and she showed a
                new-found tempo, which her team mates copied.
                <br/><br/>
                Other outstanding efforts by the girls included Karagh's brilliant flashes
                down the sidelines and after the 3rd occasion, the girl who had chased her
                exhaustedly said, "I can't catch you" and was ready to concede if Karagh got
                the ball again. Karagh's straight line speed and first touch has provided the
                team with several scoring opportunities, if only she would listen to Dad. Yes,
                I'm with Mohammad, they are just like their mothers!
                <br/><br/>
                Remember the wicked left-foot of Sophie? Well even though she is a natural
                right-footer, Sophie has the ability to hammer the ball across the goal mouth
                from the left side of the field. She did just that on several occasions, which
                allowed our increasing number of forwards to take shots at the goal from right
                in front. With Jemma doing the same from the right-hand side and Paula taking
                corners, we should have plenty of opportunities for Amany, Mia and our
                part-time forwards including Leeanna, Benhita, Gaelyn, Stella and Ellen to
                score a couple of goals soon. I think we might see Paula's name on the
                scoreboard before too long, she just keeps getting better and better. One
                from outside the penalty box would be good!
                <br/><br/>
                Again we were enthralled by the skills displayed by our girls, whether it be
                linking 4 or 5 passes together to cut through the opposition, the calling of
                square, switch and line; using the width of the field to gain easy yards; or
                more importantly, the desire to learn and share in the excitement of being
                part of a team, the <span class="wildcats">Wildcatz</span>.
                <br/><br/>
                I should mention, as the second half progressed and the score went more our
                way, we repositioned a lot of the girls, usually straight to the back line.
                I think we ended up with 6 backs, in an attempt to slow the game down. It's
                very unusual to have so must talent available in one team and be able to play
                any of the girls anywhere on the field, without losing the structure.
                <br/><br/>
                I haven't been able to mention everybody this week simply because everybody
                is playing so well and giving their best. It is difficult to single out that
                extra special moment, when you all make the whole game something very special
                for us. I just can't wait for our game next week and Tess to come back! Ok!
                Ok! the AXE wasn't that bad!
                <br/><br/>
                Come on, <span class="wildcats">Wildcatz</span> get the beat! Let us hear you
                stomp your feet!
                <br/>
                Come on, <span class="wildcats">Wildcatz</span> get the groove! Let us see
                you jump and move!
                <br/><br/>
                Go <span class="wildcats">Wildcatz</span>,
                Go <span class="wildcats">Wildcatz</span>,
                Go <span class="wildcats">Wildcatz</span>... Yay!

                A disappointing loss to a team that could well have been beaten with a show
                of some determination and commitment. The match on our part was characterised
                by a lack of hunger for the ball with the team often times showing a reluctance
                to be first to the ball, this lethargy applied to all players from goalkeeper
                through to forwards. An inability to mark up in defence also allowed the
                opposition far too much latitude in playing the ball to unmarked players,
                whereas in attack our boys tended to bunch up (under 8 style) thereby shutting
                down passing options and allowing Glenhaven to easily deal with our attacking
                moves. Another area of concern was the failure to clear the ball decisively
                from within our own penalty area. Boys this is not an area for indecision or
                fancy work, the ball needs to be cleared strongly and quickly up the field,
                2 of the goals on Saturday resulted from players not effectively clearing the
                ball from within our danger zone.
                <br/><br/>
                This game had none of the attributes of the  first up win where solid teamwork
                in defence and attack with great interpassing led to a solid win. I can only
                hope that the effort last Saturday was a one off occurrence and that after
                some solid work at training this week that the team will lift its performance
                in coming weeks and play up to its true potential.

                <br/><br/>
                The game started with a flurry and Nth Ryde had some lovely early through
                balls which found their mark early. Mark VH controlled the middle of the
                park with some great touches. Unfortunately the boys could not convert 3
                early chances, which as it turns out would become the order of the day.
                The old boys certainly kept the young 20 year olds from Mac Uni running
                all over the park! Macca had a great shot on goal which was crossed by a
                brilliant corner from Pommie Pete, which again missed its intended target.
                It was then Pommie Pete's turn to try his luck at finding the back of the
                net and the header he delivered look certain to find it - however once
                again the glad wrap was wrapped around the goals.
                <br/><br/>
                Macquarie finally had a charge at our goals but the brick - AKA - Higgo
                came from nowhere to produce a great cover tackle to save a certain goal.
                Nth Ryde were playing like 18 year olds again - someone forgot to tell them
                that it's not State League. Higgo was involved in the play again with yet
                another great cover tackle but this time came off second best and had to
                limp to the sideline. Midway through the first half Macquarie found another
                gear and put Agro under some pressure which he brushed aside with ease.
                <br/><br/>
                Col then had another shot on goal which again missed, the replacements came
                thick and fast - it seemed the boys had finally realised they were in the 40
                something category (well most of them). Macca then put a perfect ball through
                to Bruce who had a shot which was saved yet again by the Mac Uni keeper. Some
                great passing thru the centre led to a brilliant strike by Mark M which yet
                again was saved. The frustration was beginning to build on and off the field.
                <br/><br/>
                Smithy showed great courage in the backs, unfortunately for Nth Ryde some
                crucial off sides did not go their way. Macquarie Uni caught Nth Ryde napping
                and scored, Nth Ryde however put the pressure straight back on the youngsters.
                Pierre had two great shots on goal which were again saved, the frustration
                was mounting.
                <br/><br/>
                1-0 Macquarie Uni half time
                <br/><br/>
                <span class="underline">Second half highlights</span>
                <br/><br/>
                Nth Ryde came out firing in the second half and it would seem that the break
                did them well. Pommie Pete missed another shot on goal however, and everyone
                on the sideline was left scratching their heads wondering if a goal would
                ever come Nth Ryde's way. Then it finally did - Pommie Pete gobbled up a
                mistake by the opposition and drew level. The crowd went wild! Nth Ryde kept
                the pressure on and remained in Macquarie's half; Col hit a beautiful ball
                which was again saved by the keeper. It was then Pierre's turn, to no avail.
                The sideline was frustrated to say the least and keep it clean.
                <br/><br/>
                Again Nth Ryde had two hits on goal, one was saved by the keeper only to
                rebound to Col's feet who hit it straight into the cross bar. The crowd
                sighed in unison. Macca then took a throw in which he placed in the box
                perfectly, Pommie Pete turned, hit it and the ball shot into the back of
                the net. Yay - Nth Ryde were finally in the lead! At half time Macca had
                made a big call saying that if Nth Ryde scored once, they would go onto
                score 5 - could it be that he knew something we didn't?
                <br/><br/>
                Macquarie then stepped up the pace - it seemed they had come to play football
                after all. They had some precious minutes in the Nth Ryde half which lead to
                the equalizer. Macquarie then followed this up immediately with another goal
                from a Nth Ryde error. Nth Ryde had to re-group, which they did and had
                another couple of shots on goal which amounted to nothing. Higgo then copped
                a knock to the nose from his own team mate - hard head Macca which meant the
                claret began to flow.
                <br/><br/>
                Smithy had the perfect opportunity to equalize but sent the ball flying over
                the top of goals. Nth Ryde scrambled to find that extra goal. Full time, the
                crowd was left wondering whether Nth Ryde would ever get a win on the board.
                Macca's prediction was close - 5 goals - but not all to one team!
                <br/><br/>
