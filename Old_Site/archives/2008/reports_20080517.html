                A great day for soccer today, the sun was shining, grounds were in good
                nick and the team were ready for a big game.
                <br/><br/>
                The game started a tight tussle, with some great ball skills coming into
                play. Aden and Arlen worked well up front with good passing, and strong
                shots for goal. They were well supported by Zoe, Alex and Alex who all
                tackled well and put some good balls forward for them. Our "Rock" in
                defence, Troy, again backed up well and put some good clearance kicks
                up field.
                Troy had such a good game, once the full time whistle went he came over
                and asked "can we have another game?"!
                <br/><br/>
                The whole team have improved out of sight over the last few weeks! This
                showed when, after the tight start early, they ended up on a roll with
                goals and finished with a 10-2 score line to North Ryde.

                The Knight's first goal of the day was scored by Daniel aided by good
                side work from the team, and some skilled pass work by Hayden and Hugh.
                Score: 1-0. After the first round of subs a goal got through by the Panthers
                despite talented foot work by Will Hanley. Score: 1-1. A great kick down the
                field by William Briese, and some tricky defence from the whole team deflected
                a chance at goal by the Panthers. However, a few moments later a small gap in
                that defence network let them through. Score: 1-2. After more substitutions Daniel
                and the team took them on to score again, and again, for a half time score of 3-2.
                <br/><br/>
                The second half saw the Knights kicking from the west into the morning sun,
                and after a few deliberations about which direction they were going in, some
                solid teamwork by Henry and Hayden helped Daniel with his fourth goal of the
                day. Score: 4-2. Daniel had a rest in the second round substitutions, and, despite
                some good defending, a struggle ensued for the Knights and the Panthers scored again.
                Score: 4-3. Later, some good pass work at the Knight's goal end led to Daniel taking
                the ball all the way to the Panthers goal for a final time score of 5-3 to the Knights.
                <br/><br/>
                All agreed it had been a nail biter of a game, that we were learning to pull together
                as a team, and soccer was indeed the winner at the end of the day. A trophy was awarded
                to Hayden Fowler, voted by his team-mates as Man of the Match for some sensational defending.
                <br/><br/>
                A beautiful morning, some tired legs, and have a great weekend folks. See
                you all next time.

                The green Koalas arrived at Holy Cross ready to put on a display that was
                going to bamboozle the Rangers and had it not been for the climbing of Mt
                Everest to get to their ground, they probably would have! (Just kidding...
                but it was a pretty steep climb when you're carrying kids and chairs).
                Anyway, back to the game.
                <br/><br/>
                This turned out to be a another classic U7 clash with the ball going from
                one end of the field to the other as well as some "heavy" encounters in the
                middle of the park. It was pretty clear from the start that the two teams
                were evenly matched and it was only going to take a mistake on the part of
                one team that would separate them and that's pretty much how it turned out.
                We were in the fortunate position of actually having "fresh" reserves for
                this game and it seemed to help as our boys (and girl) were full of running
                right up until the end (and I mean the end... even when they all started to
                roll down Mt Everest).
                <br/><br/>
                Charlie, who was only available for the first half of the game, had another
                blinder. His clever positioning at the back and his speed off the mark make
                him a potent weapon hard to deal with... he was missed in the second half
                but the rest of the team, led by Jarvis, who just doesn't stop running, and
                Daniel, who is really starting to get involved in the tuff stuff, kept the
                momentum going. Jaiden has become our pull-back specialist... he managed two
                or three of these effective moves that left our opponents with no answer and
                got our team going forward every time... becoming a very skillful little
                player, our Jaiden. James and Jack were very willing all game as well, even
                when coming off with crippling injuries (sounds better if you dramatise it a
                little). We just couldn't keep either of them out of the action as they were
                desperate to get back out there.
                <br/><br/>
                Our player of the match for her all-round skill and determination was once
                again Lioda. Lioda is certainly not intimidated by any of the boys regardless
                of their size and more often than not gives better than she gets. Lioda was
                excellent on the ball, often setting up her team mates with clever little
                passes and as always, solid in defence.
                <br/><br/>
                Coach Garry has a bit of work to do with the kick-ins from the goal line...
                particularly kicking across the front of our goal which proved to be the
                difference. Hopefully he still has some hair left on Wednesday. Regardless
                of that there were seven smiling faces at the end of the game and that's the
                most important thing.

                The run of good weather has marched on unabated and it was another perfect
                Autumn day out at Hayes No 3 in Galston, nothing like the frost-bitten

                Eagles squad led a barrage of successive attacks on the Blues goals that
                not only kept our team in check but also earned them 2 goals within the first
                ten minutes of the game. But as the first half wore on it became evident
                that the Blues, left to their own devices, were starting to read the game
                well and understand the capacity of their opposition. They spread themselves
                wider across the field and began a series of forward surges with some
                excellent dribbling and passing shots. And then there's always that bit
                where we hold our breath as the team comes within a sniff of the goals and
                takes on a dogged determination to finish the job they'd started. They
                crashed through the Eagles defences twice to draw level at half time.
                <br/><br/>
                It was good to have <span class="bold">Tom O</span> back with us again who,
                despite still recovering from the stitches in his knee made a terrific job
                of marking his opponent and making it extremely difficult for them to get
                past him. And our indefatigable <span class="bold">Tom H</span> did not let
                his recent bout of tonsillitis deter the manner in which he continues to
                control the ball with unflustered and inimitable ease, and set the stage
                for many of the forward surges that followed.
                <br/><br/>
                As the second half progressed, so too did the character of this young Blue
                team. The increase in their confidence was almost tangible and towards the
                end of the game they were all but invincible. Taskmaster
                <span class="bold">Shannon</span> once again gave it his all from start to
                finish, and beware the goalkeeper who dares not hold onto the ball properly
                when this young man is about. <span class="bold">Adam</span> replaced his
                ambidextrous feet and skillful dribbling with a good spell as goal-keeper
                in the second half, not allowing a single ball to cross the threshhold. Young
                <span class="bold">Christopher's</span> foot skills were impressive and some
                of his daring and effective challenges on the opposition were from the top
                shelf. As Tony says, 'Christopher will put his head where most would not even
                put their feet'&nbsp;
                <img class="top noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_smiling.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                <span class="bold">Jack</span> as usual showed us what he is capable of with
                the ball and had some terrific and skillful runs at goal.
                <span class="bold">Eli</span> is a danger to the opposition no matter what
                part the field he finds himself in, and his fearless approach to the game
                always keeps the opposition guessing. <span class="bold">David</span>
                ran himself ragged in both defense and attack, and showed terrific skill
                and determination to keep the ball in the opposition half that eventually
                earned him player of the match. And how good was it to watch
                <span class="bold">Charlie</span>, especially when he collects the ball
                somewhere around the halfway line and starts making it all happen with
                some scintillating runs at goal. <span class="bold">Patrick</span> was at
                full-throttle all day, running, passing, tackling and delivering a maximum
                performance for his team. Thanks also to <span class="bold">Thomas M</span>
                who helped out as a reserve for the match and who also produced some
                stylish dribbling and effective forward play. His efforts are much
                appreciated.
                <br/><br/>
                The Blues built on their confidence minute by minute in the second half and
                were a pleasure to watch. They gave themselves the opportunity to take
                control of the field and were reading the game extremely well. Three further
                unanswered goals took them through to the final whistle to win the match 5-2.
                <br/><br/>
                This was a terrific effort by a team that showed a lot of compusure as the
                game progressed, undaunted by the pressure that was placed on them at the
                start of the match and teaching us all a lesson in patience and persistence.
                Thanks also to all the family and friends who provided support and
                encouragement to the team without any disproportionate coaching from the
                sideline&nbsp;

                This week all the players really shone! We mixed up the positions a bit to
                give a few of the players some variety and they really enjoyed the scenery
                that different parts of the field afford! <span class="bold">Thomas</span>,
                our usual sweeper, had a great time as striker and slotted a great runaway goal.
                It was superbly set up by player of the match, <span class="bold">Harrison</span>,
                who tackled ferociously and passed the ball incessantly, as well as slotting a
                goal himself. Our usual striker <span class="bold">Maggie</span> enjoyed the
                freedom of stopper and was frequently seen up front organising, dribbling and
                calling for the ball. <span class="bold">Ben</span> is really getting the hang
                of tackling and kept putting all 22 kgs of his frame on the line. Mr and Mr
                reliable <span class="bold">Tim</span> and <span class="bold">Josh</span> were
                fab with <span class="bold">Timmy</span> really showing us his great pullback
                skills and <span class="bold">Josh</span> enjoying his stint in goals.
                <br/><br/>
                West Ryde Rovers were good but certainly beatable and if our backs hadn't
                nodded off, they wouldn't have got 2 quick goals - but everyone needs to
                get in and continue to call for the ball and find free space. It is great to
                see the players developing and taking so much in - their enthusiasm continues
                to amaze us all.
                <br/><br/>
                It seems that <span class="bold">Brooke</span> enjoyed being this week's
                sweeper as she organised her troops and did lots of calling.
                <span class="bold">Luke</span> was up and down the field from his fullback
                position trying to be in everything and <span class="bold">Kireth</span>
                was good as goalie in the first half, blocking lots of shots. Special
                mention to <span class="bold">Taylor</span> who quietly went about her
                business in running rings around the opposition and was rewarded with
                this week's encouragement medallion.
                <br/><br/>
                In the end, Rovers got the bickies, but we all had fun and that is the main
                thing! Next week we will continue to try to mark up (magnets) quickly at
                throw-ins and remember to keep running for the whole game.

                We went into the game with a feeling we had a chance given our previous
                performance against Glenhaven (2-all). However, it was not long into the
                game that we realised we were facing a dramatically improved team. Glenhaven
                capitalised on our weaknesses, particularly in tackling and keeping the ball
                from our goal area. North Ryde maintained more of a contest in the first half,
                and were just 2-1 down at half time. Two great goals from Alex (in the 1st
                half) and Isaac (2nd half) resulted from speed and gritty determination
                following some clever pacing from team mates. William was awarded Player
                of the Match.

                Our boys had most of the possession in the first half, perhaps a bit too much
                as we were unable to release it for a goal! Minutes before half time, West
                Ryde Rovers caught us napping with a lucky lob from just passed the halfway
                line which floated gracefully into the back of our net - I think even the
                scorer was surprised.
                <br/><br/>
                1-0 down, we commenced the second half with some piercing runs down the wings
                with the likes of Luke and Arman weaving in and out of the midfield to provide
                through balls. Although we were in danger of being caught offside, the boys had
                their heads up and played attacking football. Tom and Elia consistently closed
                off any menacing attacks from the Rovers strikers, and our defence held firm
                with Chris and the lads in the back row supporting our fearless keeper Lachlan.
                Cameron delivered a perfect cross that only required a sneeze to get the ball
                over the goal line, but again we were denied.  Later, another great cross saw
                Hayden launch himself over their defenders and head the ball in from the edge
                of the box, completely beating their keeper to make it 1-1.
                <br/><br/>
                Overall, this was the best performance from the lads who showed great spirit
                to fight back and level the game. The communication amongst the players with
                regard to short passes is improving, and this augurs well for the next game.

                Today's game was against the highly regarded West Pennant Hills-Cherrybrook
                Lions, who had apparently beaten Kenthurst & District convincingly, who in
                turn had easily defeated us in our first game of the season. Even in the
                face of these Lions, North Ryde stood strong and tall and in the end the
                Lions appeared tamer than first thought against the Pride of the North Ryde
                pack. In the first half we held them off for a long time, with Nat in goals
                saving a number and strong defence by Robert and friends but in the end they
                scored a goal. Andrew and David were both seen tackling the ball from the
                opposition with great enthusiasm, and Sage, Benjamin, and Tanis performed
                some good kicks forward.
                <br/><br/>
                In the second half, an attack from the Lions put our goals at risk but after
                some brave defence a penalty was awarded to the Lions. Robert was ready for
                anything even though the kick at goals missed by miles. There was another
                time when Taj, Tim and Jaiden were running the ball up the field and they
                could have scored but unluckily the ref decided that Jaiden was offside and
                a free kick was awarded to the opposition. One of the twins tricked a big guy
                and got past him and on another occasion one of their players roared (perhaps
                trying to live up to being a Lion?) in an attempt to scare our player.&nbsp;
                <img class="top noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_rolling_eyes.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                The rest of the players supported well and overall the whole team should
                lift their heads high for a competitive game. Throughout the game, the Lions
                had kept us from scoring and hence the 1-0 loss in the end.

                Well ladies and gentlemen, it's what you have all been waiting for, the
                rematch of the highly-fancied first round champions North Ryde and the
                overwhelmed challenger Putney Rangers. The last time these two opponents
                met, NR displayed gladiatorial excellence and fistic fortitude, to win 6-nil
                on points. Under FFA rulings there must be 2 rematches to determine who gains
                the right to fight for the winner takes all World Championship Match. Let me
                just recap on there last encounter; The Rangers lacked a defensive strategy
                or a knock out blow; while the <span class="wildcats">Wildcatz</span> were,
                in the words of a great champion, able to 'float like a butterfly and sting
                like a bee'.
                <br/><br/>
                Ladies and Gentlemen for either team to win today they will need to be on
                top of their game, make full use of any lapses in the opponents defences or
                concentration, and make every chance count.
                <br/><br/>
                With the difficulty of organising 14 players, Tess has recruited the AXE to
                assist with substitutions. Let me tell those who haven't tried the job of
                subbing, it is one of the hardest jobs to do effectively, equitably and still
                maintain any advantage over the opposition. The difficulty increases
                exponentially when you're trying to sub & coach at the same time. Thanks AXE
                for helping Tess and the team.
                <br/><br/>
                Would there be a home ground advantage for the challengers or would the
                <span class="wildcats">Wildcatz</span> unleash a knock out blow before the
                final bell (whistle)?
                <br/><br/>
                With Captain Ellen (Ellzee) volunteering to be in goals, we were set for any
                possible attacking onslaught that PR's might initiate. I mean if they could
                get past our mighty defensive line up of Paulzee, Gaelyn, Lee and Stef. As it
                unfolded, Putney had trouble right from the start; the coach had decided to
                go for a very defensive line-up using six in the back line and the other 4 as
                midfielders. If Putney were to get the ball, there wasn't anybody up front to
                score anyway.
                <br/><br/>
                The only up-side of this defensive tactic was, we didn't have far to go to
                score goals, but the down side was the PR's coach had taken away any chance
                of our speedsters making a charge from half way and slotting in an easy goal.
                So with what seemed like all PR's 11 players and our 10 players in the
                confines of the penalty box, trying to get a ball between the gaps was just
                impossible. I lost count of the number of passes across the goalmouth or the
                very solid shots that were deflected, which could have resulted in the score
                being double figures to NR. But his tactics worked well, with the score
                remaining at nil-nil at half time. Our dynamic goalie Ellen never got to
                touch the ball once in the 25 minutes of play.
                <br/><br/>
                Change of goalies and Mia (Mizee) was ready for a rest. Meanwhile Tess had
                fired the girls up reminding them of the 'secret stuff' they do at training
                and plotted a strategic play to get past Putney's defences. It's some girly
                thing, so for the boys to fully grasp the concept, we would need to see the
                replay... several times, probably! Anyway the second half started just like
                the first and NR were neutralised by Putney, holding their ALL IN defensive
                line. It wasn't that Karagh, Jemma, Amany, Rokayah, Emma, Stella, Bhenita,
                Sophie, Gaelyn and Daff weren't trying their best, it was that we were simply
                playing Putney's game and not our usual open style, passing the ball on the
                run and creating the gaps.
                <br/><br/>
                With 15 minutes of the second half gone, Tess decided it was time to implement
                the secret stuff, the girly thing, and the strategic play. With Putney's
                keeper firing the ball down the centre of the field for about the twentieth
                time in the half, Tess calmly called out 'Hit it Paulzee!'. I say calmly, but
                for all those people who were within a 2km radius, they would of heard the
                call, or a least felt the shock wave as Paulzee hit the ball so hard there
                was a tell-tale vapour trail 40 metres long, from the point of impact all
                the way over the goalies outstretched arms in to the back of the nets. The
                ball had travelled in a perfect arc from ground level to 20 metres elevation
                and back to ground level again.
                <br/><br/>
                The crowd, I mean our crowd went wild with joy, while Paula, Ellen and Jemma
                all celebrated by performing cartwheels along the cricket pitch. As Maxwell
                Smart would say, 'The old ace up the coaches sleeve trick'! Not a bad option,
                when a defensive back can deliver a KNOCK OUT BLOW or STING LIKE A BEE, just
                as Paulzee did from almost the half way line. Apparently Tess and Paula had
                cunningly developed the plan during training. This now takes the number of
                girls scoring goals so far to 6, who will be next?
                <br/><br/>
                Last week I mentioned Stella, Bhenita and Ellen rising to the next level of
                commitment and determination. I don't know if its what they're eating for
                breakfast or if they've been watching the World Game on SBS, but I am truly
                excited each and every time either of them touch the ball. Stella has shown
                that she can be extremely quick, able to outrun most girls on the field and
                can take control of the side channels. Bhenita is just going from strength
                to strength, getting involved and reading the game like a veteran.
                <br/><br/>
                I had to look twice on several occasions because Ellen and Sophie look very
                similar from a distance and especially when moving away from you. They both
                have a natural ability to cut through opponents going left then right, back
                to the left up along the left-hand side of the field and providing excellent
                crosses from the corner. Now, do you all remember only 3 weeks ago Ellen
                tugging on my shirt and saying 'Dave, please don't put me forward I only like
                being a back'? How things can change.
                <br/><br/>
                It might seem like our forwards and midfielders do all the hard work keeping
                the ball up front, but we have a dynamic little back by the name of Leeanna
                (Leezee or more preferably Annzee) who is very, very good and especially in
                a sweeper role. From the very start she adopted the position and has displayed
                a natural game sense, the ability to be in the right spot at just the right
                time. She is quiet on and off the field, but has the determination and speed
                to neutralise any attacking situation. I wonder what she could do up front
                given the chance?
                <br/><br/>
                Even though the final score was only 1-nil to the
                <span class="wildcats">Wildcatz</span>, they showed composure and a winning
                edge throughout. Teams that you meet during the 2nd round will be more
                prepared, so remember Tess's instructions, FIRST TO THE BALL and
                TRIANGLES. Look for options if you have the ball and provide options to
                receive the ball.
                <br/><br/>
                It's exciting watching all you girls play the game so well, each week your
                improvement is measurable. It's not measured by the number of goals scored,
                but more importantly by your friendships, by your passion, by the attitude
                and the respect that you give to Tess and Michael, and most importantly your
                happiness.

                Another good game of soccer from a team that continues improving week by
                week. All members of the team competed strongly, Lewis B was his usual
                tenacious self challenging strongly for the ball at all times. Sam B
                competed well in goals during the first half and was unlucky to have 2
                goals scored against him. William G played well in the midfield during
                the first half tackling strongly and distributing the ball well to support
                players. His positive contribution continued in the second half when in
                goals where he was forced to make a number of strong saves. John P played
                well and threatened the Thornleigh defence repeatedly. Liam T played strongly
                and was full of running throughout the entire game. Well done to everyone on
                never giving up and trying to the very end.
                <br/><br/>
                This game was a close fought affair from two very evenly matched teams and
                although we came out on the wrong end of the score line the team certainly
                created several scoring chances with an amazing 9 shots on goal without any
                being converted. Poor shot choices with players trying to shoot through the
                opposing goalkeeper rather than past him looking for the angles to beat him
                cost the team dearly in the end. Team think about this and try and put better
                finishing skills into practice in your next match. Keep your heads up and keep
                on playing for each other - a win is just around the corner.
