                My, what a white knuckle ride it was for the supporters of this game on
                Saturday.  Parents, grandparents, siblings and bystanders alike were all
                thrilled by performances by both teams as they gallantly defended their goals.
                <br/><br/>
                The Panthers were early on the attack and had the ball up in the Knights end
                seconds after the starting whistle, but some good tackling and a great kick
                by Hayden Fowler saved the Knights from what might have been an embarrassingly
                early goal. Will Hanley was called off for injury time which was closely followed
                by a very close call at the Panther's goal by Henry Barnes. A great tackle and
                turn by Jasmine Parian made this match a real ding dong battle.
                <br/><br/>
                Despite some sound defense by the Knights and a huge kick up the mid field
                by William Briese, the ball was kicked in by the Panthers for the first goal
                of the day. Briese then continued his sterling form for the day by performing
                a goal-saving tackle followed by a solid attempt at scoring.
                <br/><br/>
                Score at half time: Knights 0 - Panthers 1
                <br/><br/>
                Second half started with a long run by Ben Lau for a near goal, saved at
                the last minute by the Panthers right on the goal line. You should have
                heard the crowd gasp...
                <br/><br/>
                Jasmine took a long range shot and our man Briese took it for a brilliant
                goal. One all. A super fast breakaway by the Panthers had the Knights chasing
                them up field - they were so fast the Knights could only watch as the opposition
                had a fair crack at an undefended goal. It was a near miss. The crowd were on the
                edge of their seats!
                <br/><br/>
                Back to the other end just as fast and a very close call for Henry Barnes
                again as his attempt at goal hit the crossbar. But William Briese had full
                control of the next opportunity, and Goooaaallla!!! as they say in European
                commentary. 2-1. The last few minutes of the game had both sets of supporters
                yelling for all they were worth. Hayden Fowler displayed some fine turning skills
                as he passed gracefully to William Briese for his third goal. The Panthers came
                very close to taking their second goal, but the Knights were in all the wrong
                places for them, for a closing score of 3 - 0 to the Knights.
                <br/><br/>
                What a game, what a game, what a game. We are getting better and better.
                Well done North Ryde White Knights, well done Wayne. Thank you Bill and
                Livia, and see you at the next nail-biter. Have a good holiday everyone.

                With our coach and manager both away on Origin duty (sounds better than they
                both had to be somewhere else) as well as one of our main strike weapons being
                on 'loan' for the week, the green Koalas seemingly didn't have the ideal
                preparation so not too much was expected of them. After a few shots on goal
                and a quick 'pep' talk from the stand-in coach, looked like all was in
                readiness. The only real concern was the lure of the playground that just
                happened to be right next to our playing field and there were already comments
                being made about the reserves playing in there while waiting to be called on!
                <br/><br/>
                As soon as the whistle blew, this enthusiastic outfit clicked straight into
                gear and it was business as usual. Without the services of Jarvis for this
                game, James and Jack both put up their hands to take on the extra workload
                and were both terrific in getting involved in the thick of the action. Jack
                was very cunning, often tricking his opponents into thinking he wasn't
                watching the ball and them coming from nowhere to take the ball off them.
                Lioda was powerful in defence, producing some effective tackles on bigger
                opponents. Daniel was again strong at the back and held the Dragons at bay
                a few times and didn't panic under pressure by kicking the ball to the safety
                of the sideline when required.
                <br/><br/>
                Whilst we were without Jarvis this week we were very lucky to gain the
                services of Hugh, who was outstanding! His combination with Charlie from the
                kick-ins and general play was as if they played together every week. They were
                instrumental in a lot of our chances on goal. It didn't take them long to work
                out a tactic they often caught the Dragons napping.
                <br/><br/>
                Our Player of the Match this week went to Jaiden. With each week that passes,
                Jaiden adds a new trick to his growing repertoire. He constantly goes looking
                for the ball which sometimes results in him being injured, but being a tough
                little cookie he gets straight back into it.
                <br/><br/>
                A very entertaining match played in a great spirit. Congratulations to both
                teams and their supporters who added to the enjoyment. Thank you also to David
                for taking on the manager's role at short notice and providing each of the
                players with an encouragement award voucher, which they all thought was
                terrific.

                The Blues were very quick out of the starting blocks against a polished
                and Argentinian-clad All Saints team this morning, and led the game by
                2 goals to nil at the break after several superb moves up the field. Each
                surge was invariably initiated by a bit of Tom H wizardry deep in the Blues
                half, followed by some terrific teamwork and passing to take the ball into
                the danger zone, and ending, on two occasions, with Charlie's timely boot
                to find the back of the Saints' net.
                <br/><br/>
                Not so the second half though. The Blues seemed to run out of steam in
                uncustomary fashion and were hard pressed to keep a rejunvenated All Saints
                team at bay, who came back strongly to level the score at 2 goals apiece
                which is how it remained until the final whistle blew.

                This week, the game was a cracker against Pennant Hills even though we lost.

                In fact, the whole team played a great game and put in a huge effort with lots
                of support play and kicking to free space. We had many attempts at goal but
                Pennant Hills defence was just too strong.

                It was only really a 20 minute drive out to Glenhaven and a very pleasant
                one at that! The players were looking forward to playing with nets and posts
                as well as a rope to keep the parents & supporters at arm's length... the
                coaches were relishing the extra room to move too!
                <br/><br/>
                The first 10 minutes were very tight with both teams having their chances.
                <span class="bold">Julian</span> did his usual number of fantastic big
                kicks, <span class="bold">Taylor</span> was very busy getting in there
                and having a go while <span class="bold">Kireth</span> was ever reliable
                in defence getting back to help. Glenhaven had definitely played this game
                before and they had a couple of sharp shooters who took advantage of our
                momentary lapses in concentration (2 of them), and kicked 2 quick goals.
                <br/><br/>
                At the break it was 0 - 2 and the coaching staff commented that the
                seemingly smaller pitch size contributed greatly to the players bunching
                up. In the second half, <span class="bold">Luke</span> and
                <span class="bold">Ben</span> certainly helped to change this sideline
                impression with some great kicks and thoughtful passing to free space. The
                score remained the same for the second half thanks to
                <span class="bold">Thomas</span> who continues to impress, this week with
                some skilful trapping and a couple of <span class="bold">very</span> big
                clearances.
                <br/><br/>
                <span class="bold">Maggie</span> was again a standout - she is our star
                striker and every week puts in 100% with persistent dribbling, running
                and following through. We all enjoyed watching player of the match
                <span class="bold">Josh</span> who was everywhere - even tried out a
                stint as striker and was very thoughtful with his positional play.
                <span class="bold">Tim</span> excelled again with some great pullbacks
                and he is also taking to 'positional play' like a pro!
                <br/><br/>
                At the end of the game, the management team were at odds as to who to give
                the encouragement award to - there were so many standouts and try hards.
                Eventually, we decided on <span class="bold">Brooke</span> for her gallant
                effort as first half goalie. We all need to remember that if a goal is
                scored, it isn't really the goalies fault - rather, the 8 other players
                that allowed the ball to get down that far.
                <br/><br/>
                Enjoy the holidays, you deserve so much with your willingness to learn and
                happy approach to the beautiful game!

                Not only the existing two players down (Jared & Isaac) but we had Ben away
                sick. Fortunately, we were able to call on Shannon Condon from U8 to make
                up the 11 players. Thanks Shan!
                <br/><br/>
                A very early and chilly start, an 08:15 kick off at Galston. We initially
                placed Josh in the goal and he did a great job, saving 6 attempts at goal
                by WPH before being replaced by Ryan who was suffering from stomach cramps.
                Under the circumstances Ryan did exceptionally well at goal keeping. In
                particular he saved a goal from an unmarked striker. Well done!
                <br/><br/>
                Regrettably the 1st goal was an own goal from trying to head the ball out
                of the goal from a corner kick. NRS defence worked hard. One notable player
                was William who managed to block the ball on a number of occasions.
                Unfortunately, WPH defence were very good at passing the ball back down
                into NRS half with lofty kicks, seldom did the strikers see the ball much
                to NRS frustration. James and Tom both tried to score goals from afar, but
                on both occasions the ball landed in WPH GK hands. The two players who gave
                it their all appeared to have run at least 20kms Aymon and 'Pocket Rocket'
                Shannon are the youngest and smallest of the NRS team.
                <br/><br/>
                James came off 12 minutes to full time with an injury to the ankle from a
                tackle. Consequently, NRS were down one player on the field. Fortunately,
                the team pulled together to keep the score goalless for the remainder of
                the game. Overall the boys played well and managed to reduce the score from
                a previous match against WPH (the current leader in the comp). Player of the
                match was awarded to Tom.

                On Saturday the boys took on a classy Epping side. Epping caught the boys
                napping in the first couple of minutes and put one in the back of the net.
                This stunned the boys into action but they were still not firing on all
                cylinders. An attacking raid by Epping saw a shot hit the post. Elia made
                some good runs early. The boys were starting to match it with Epping and
                they were looking more threatening.
                <br/><br/>
                Epping continued to look good early in the second half but the boys rallied
                and started to string some passes together and had some early chances.
                Cameron produced a great corner in the 10th min of the second half but the
                boys still remained goalless. A few minutes later Cam had a shot but the back
                of the net was undisturbed. Soon after this Ben had a shot which just sailed
                over the top bar. Again Ben started with a great ball to Luke who ran like
                the wind and a goal looked likely but still no result.
                <br/><br/>
                Hayden had a shot late in the half but unfortunately we did not trouble the
                score.
                <br/><br/>
                It was a very exciting game and the boys got better and better and really
                started to look strong and were the better team in the second half. Everyone
                played really well and it was a great team effort.
                <br/><br/>
                Next time Epping won't be so lucky!!

                Once again on Saturday the boys continued to be a statistician's worst
                nightmare, as they continue to prove that statistics do lie. As in the
                previous match the boys played the more enterprising soccer dominated
                possession, territory, shots on goal and corners, however failed to secure
                the points in what would have been a deserved win. Our boys once again
                made all the running for much of the match with some enterprising play
                by the forwards featuring some great passing and combinations that
                eventually led to a well taken goal by Stephen BH after an excellent
                cross from Lewis B.
                <br/><br/>
                The defence for much of the match was excellent and featured some fine
                close marking of key players particularly by Tyler R who kept Thornleigh's
                danger man out of the game whenever he was on the field, well done Tyler,
                special mention also to Matt U who also had a strong game in defence
                tackling strongly and disposing of the ball intelligently when he won
                possession. Well done Matt & Tyler, probably your best games of the season.
                A positive attitude at training does have its rewards!
                <br/><br/>
                Sam B, Liam T, Jake R and Tim B all played strongly at the back. Lewis B,
                Dana B and Jordan C all continue to impress with their tenacity and the
                combinations they have developed, they were ably supported by Victor C and
                Havig K. John P was once again dominant and threatened to score whenever
                he had the ball and his set plays were once again spot on.
                <br/><br/>
                Another big effort is required this Saturday if the team is to advance to
                the semi final rounds, the team's efforts over the past few weeks have been
                deserving of better results so with continued effort and an ounce of luck
                hopefully the deserved result will be achieved.

                Stand in Coach Barry seemed to have his plans for the team all worked out,
                the only problem was that he hadn't let the boys know what was going on and
                when Col asked him who was starting on the sideline, Barry's answer was 'I
                have no idea'. Perhaps it was a brilliant tactical ploy by Baz to keep his
                guys and the other guys guessing. It could also mean good things for Nth
                Ryde today, time would tell.
                <br/><br/>
                Flocko was at his pre game best and after applying a whole tube of over
                35's liniment he was ready to fire. The only problem was that he had left
                his gorgeous daughter Grace in my care and had left her a broken chair to
                sit on. It seems that Flocko with the council clean up the week prior had
                thrown out the good working chair and kept the broken one. It all gave us
                a good laugh and gave me something to write about again - thanks Flocko!
                <br/><br/>
                On to the game, Nth Ryde started with 3 reserves. Mark M was being a girl
                and pretending to have a rib injury, Ado used every muscle he could muster
                last week to score his first goal for the season, which meant he was sidelined
                with some sort of ailment this week (slipped disc or something- no excuse
                really) and Greg Smith was called into work (poor excuse Greg - soccer ALWAYS
                comes first). This probably wasn't such a bad thing though as the boys were
                due to face a double header this weekend and Macca had already made the
                comment that Greg could play tomorrow's match all by himself as none of the
                boys could back up! Coach Darren was playing up with his wife somewhere in
                Sydney - but we had Baz!
                <br/><br/>
                So the whistle blew and the running began. With 3rd place playing 4th place
                it was bound to be a good game, only one goal separated these teams at their
                last encounter. The boys started well, Bruce had an early shot which flew
                over the top of goals. Soon after, Macca and Pommie Pete both had shots
                which missed. Nth Ryde then had another chance with some good pressure by
                Macca on the keeper. On the other hand, Hicko, Smithy and Brownie were doing
                a great job protecting the goals and delivering great balls through to the
                rest of the boys. Flocko and Firgal in the midfield looked like spritely
                young teenagers today, but would it last? It seemed Nth Epping Rangers had
                some celebrities on their team, as there was one player who looked
                distinctively like Belinda Neal MP, she, I mean he, had plenty of aggression
                and let our boys know about it. Nth Epping gave three free kicks away in the
                first half through their inability to control their aggression; at least
                Pommie seemed to have his in check today! Not only were they aggressive but
                the whining and winging, honestly our kids behaved better than Nth Epping.
                Pierre replaced Bruce and as Bruce walked off, Nth Epping scored. Nth Ryde
                had lost their composure and Nth Epping sounded more like girls as the game
                went on. By half time Nth Ryde looked wrecked and as the ref blew half time,
                Flocko's chair gave way with him in it! The girls (the partners that is - not
                Nth Epping Rangers) were laughing their heads off!!
                <br/><br/>
                1-0 Nth Epping Rangers
                <br/><br/>
                <span class="underline">Second half highlights</span>
                <br/><br/>
                North Epping ran on and began the chatter once again in the belief that they
                were playing all over Nth Ryde, but with some composure I had no doubt that
                the boys would score quickly. Sure enough (I should be a psychic!), a blatant
                hand ball left Nth Ryde with a free kick. The shot was taken and a rebounded
                ball landed within Flocko's reach, he hit it and the ball hit the back of
                the net! The equaliser, 1-1. Unfortunately though the boys were caught
                unawares and Nth Epping hit back immediately. This goal didn't mean that
                Nth Epping Rangers would play any better and surely they made plenty of
                mistakes as Nth Ryde composed their play and in turn rattled the opposition.
                Free kicks were given against Nth Epping Rangers as they continually pushed
                and kicked illegally. The girls on the sideline then began to stand up for
                our boys as one of the Nth Epping boys play turned ugly. He ended up being
                our best player on the day however, as the amount of free kicks he gave away
                allowed us back into the game. Brownie took a free kick about 30 metres out
                from goal and while he was targeting one of our players, it didn't go down
                that way and instead the balled curved a la David Beckham, touched nothing
                and hit the back of the net. Well it's been at least 11 years since Brownie
                scored a goal although I did find out that after the match Brownie admitted
                that he scored his last goal in 1978! The drinks are on you today Brownie!
                <br/><br/>
                Pommie had a great game down the left flank, Bruce protected the goals
                playing in the backline in the second half, Smithy rattled the opposition
                and Pierre played brilliantly up front as usual. All in all it was a great
                game by Nth Ryde against some poor opposition. There is no reason for the
                boys not to make the semis from here as they have now cemented themselves
                in fourth spot.
                <br/><br/>
                The girls need to be congratulated for lifting the boys to a 2-2 draw and
                rattling the opposition. Beth and Joy were brilliant with their wit and
                support and one of the two goals can be put down to their enthusiasm!
                <br/><br/>
                As a post script, the Nth Ryde boys played so well against Nth Epping that
                All Saints Hunters Hill got word and decided to withdraw from the competition,
                leaving Nth Ryde with a win on the 6th July and 14th July by forfeit. On the
                14th Macca and Mark Van Hilten assisted the AA12's and Pierre had a run with
                AA1's. Hopefully Pierre got his radar for scoring under control! Macca and
                Mark for my mind were the stand out players for AA12 and assisted them to
                their 2-1 win against Macquarie Dragons.
                <br/><br/>
                Well done and good luck boys.
