                The start of a new season and a huge step up to 11-a-side for the under 9. We
                arrive to find a full size pitch which had been roped off and a official ref,
                welcome to the big league. You can see why the association have brought in
                small-sided games as it is madness for eight years olds to play 11-a-side and
                have an understanding of the offside rule.
                <br/><br/>
                We had no subs so it was a full 40 mins for all. We were under pressure from
                the start with Epping having most of the play but our defence stood firm.
                Towards the end of the first half we had corner kick and we had been practising
                corners in training and bang we were one-nil up from a good strike from Jackson
                and a great corner from Sam.
                <br/><br/>
                In the second half the game was more even and we rode our luck a couple of
                times but a good move down the left from Thomas who threaded the ball to Jay
                to poke home a second goal. After the second goal we knew the points were in
                the bag.
                <br/><br/>
                Always good to get the first win and three points and if we can ground out
                results I will not be complaining. MOM to Daniel who was solid in defence and
                won some great 50-50 challenges.

                Cyndi Lauper sings, "Oh girls, they wanna have fu-un, Oh girls, just wanna
                have fun". And that's exactly what the Under 12 girls had on Sunday while
                playing their first game in the North Western Sydney Women's Football
                Associations Competition.
                <br/><br/>
                It's always best to start at the beginning, so for those who don't know, North
                Ryde now has an Under 12 girls soccer (sorry football) team playing in a Sunday
                Competition. It's the first time in the 55 years since North Ryde's formation
                that the Club has had a dedicated girl's team and, despite the lyrics in the
                song, and that most hadn't played competition soccer before, they were able to
                display soccer skills and team work which would make most weekend coaches
                envious.
                <br/><br/>
                I said most coaches but not their coach, Tess Barritt, a lovely young English
                woman, who has in a very short period of time and with a "no nonsense" approach
                guided them to an exhilarating & crowd pleasing victory.
                <br/><br/>
                Back to the start, with rain dampening this momentous occasion the girls
                gathered in the change room to adorn the mighty blue & gold jerseys, Coach
                Tess worked on a magical plan assigning the girls to field positions for the
                game. Mia in goals 1st half, Stella 2nd half, Paula, Leeanna, Bhenita, Gaelyn
                & Ellen providing the backline. Amany and Emma at the front end, with Jemma,
                Stefanie & Karagh in the midfield.
                <br/><br/>
                There wasn't any sign of apprehension or fear; the girls were just there to
                have fun. With the referee indicating he wanted the girls on the field, they
                jogged out of the change room in single file; it was just like watching the
                Matildas entering the arena, focused, with a job to do, well not really,
                despite the intimidating name <span class="wildcats">Wildcats</span>, they
                just want to have fun!
                <br/><br/>
                A sign of their inexperience; it took 3 attempts at getting the ball into play
                to satisfy the referee. It was at this point the girls forgot the lyrics in
                the song and the competitive desire to win came out. The girls dominated the
                first half, edging their way to the opposition's line, but without a goal to
                reflect the team's efforts. There wasn't a weak link in the
                <span class="wildcats">Wildcats</span> defence or attack; it was as if the
                YMCA had some invisible barrier to protect the goalmouth.
                <br/><br/>
                As Grandparents, parents, brothers, sisters, friend & neighbours nervously
                watched on, Tess coolly formulated a revised plan. At half time she simply
                reminded the girls to pass the ball wide and that would give them the space
                in the middle to attack. The opposition were good, but with the Tess's wisdom
                instilled within the girl's soccer brains the advantage was there. With some
                beautiful passes, the girls were able to put a couple of thru balls for Jemma
                (who is quicker than lightning) too charge down the field and fire off 2
                fantastic shots at the goals, only to be stopped by a fearless YMCA's goalie.
                <br/><br/>
                Our defence was so good, YMCA only made it into our half 2 or 3 times, whereas
                it felt we were almost continuously in their half, but struggling to finish
                off. Then with only minutes to full time, it happened... A GOAL, the first
                goal for the team. The North Ryde crowd went Wild, yelling, jumping &
                screaming. The girls quickly gathered in the penalty box congratulating each
                other, smiling and laughing. You could sense the emotions both on and off the
                field. You could feel the heart racing and see tears forming in the eyes of
                mothers.
                <br/><br/>
                It was an extremely exciting game to watch and the girls displayed skill and
                determination that had everybody watching intensely, however what I saw was a
                team of girls, some new to the game, (Emma only 9 years old) playing with huge
                quantities of energy, passion and commitment, playing fair, showing genuine
                concern for a player in the other team when hit in the stomach by a very hard
                ball.
                <br/><br/>
                I'm impressed by the girl's manners, their friendship, and willingness to
                listen and learn. I'm excited at the potential they have shown in just a very
                short time and look forward to watching the challenging season ahead. Their
                spontaneous excitement, the way they acknowledged each others efforts during
                and after the game, the huddle & singing of the team chant are moments that
                their coach, mums and dads will remember for seasons to come.
                <br/><br/>
                I would like to thank Tess, for taking on the coaching role, also Tim Thorne
                for his never ending assistance and Alex McCoy for rounding up a tremendous
                bunch of Truscott kids to form the team of
                <span class="wildcats">Wildcats</span>.
                <br/><br/>
                Remember, Oh girls, just wanna have fun...

                What a great start to the season for the boys who had a well deserved 5 - 0
                win over a very competent team first up. Congratulations to all the boys on
                a tremendous TEAM effort, there was not a weak link or anybody who did not
                contribute to their best on the day.
                <br/><br/>
                The game was characterized by some outstanding interchange passing in both
                the backs and the forwards, and given that the team has only had 3 training
                runs together with several new boys joining the team this year the combinations
                were great and hopefully can only improve from here.
                <br/><br/>
                Special mention to Stephen Barrett-Hough on scoring a treble first up, well
                done Stephen on some great finishing. Other goal scorers were Dana Bahrami
                and Jordan Colussi who coolly converted a penalty in the second half.
                <br/><br/>
                Although the score was 5 - 0 this was not a true reflection of the game, the
                Epping Eastwood team never stopped trying and had several attacking raids which
                were only halted by some outstanding defense, and some good goal keeping. Well
                done to all the backs and to the 2 goalkeepers Sam Bradley (1st half) &
                William Greer (2nd half), who both kept a clean sheet despite both boys having
                to make several saves in both halves.

                I am sure that Scott our new coach came away from the game feeling positive
                about the team effort and with his knowledge and the cooperation of the team
                at training this could be a great year. Remember boys your attitude and efforts
                at training will be reflected in your efforts on game day, and how far you go
                this year. Welcome aboard Scott.

                As a new parent to the club on behalf of William, Tyler, & Lewis & anyone I may
                have missed I would like to thank everyone involved with the team for the warm
                friendly welcome the boys have received and the positive spirit in the team &
                the club.
