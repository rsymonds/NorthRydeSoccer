                The Under 6A's played Ararat at Fontenoy Park. The game started well but it
                was soon evident that we were going to be outclassed as you could see that
                these guys were seasoned players. By their skill and speed, they may have
                played last year.
                <br/><br/>
                The team as a whole played well - Angus with his back pass, Elliot dropping
                back to protect his goal, Chris with his mighty run and scoring our only
                goal, Cooper with his passing and Zachary in there mixing it with the best
                of them.
                <br/><br/>
                The team came off happy that they had a good game, knowing that they had
                tried their best and had fun doing it. Our man of the match this week went
                to <span class="bold">Angus</span>.

                Pidding Park was the venue for this encounter that brought together the
                might of North Ryde's Under 7s against a very well-drilled Ryde Saints
                United team. As a result of lack of opposition for the Yellow Koalas,
                it was decided to combine the two squads together giving all the kids an
                opportunity to have some valuable game time.
                <br/><br/>
                The Yellow Koalas took to the field for the opening ten minutes of the first
                half and were quickly under siege from a very polished Ryde Saints United
                team. Not having played a game the week before as well as having training
                cancelled due to rain meant that these guys hadn't had much of an opportunity
                to develop any team cohesion thus far. What they did have though was the need
                to have a bit of fun and that they did. The slickness of the opposition meant
                that our team's defence was going to be severely tested. Coedie was
                inspirational, putting his body on the line several times with both the
                Daniels (A & B) repelling constant raids. Limited opportunities with the ball
                presented themselves, with both Hugh and Hayley making some incisive runs
                into the opposition's half only to be denied by a desperate last line of
                defence.
                <br/><br/>
                With all the defending, fresh legs were needed and on came the Green team.
                The theme of having fun was maintained, Charlie worked tirelessly trying
                to set up team mates in better positions, Jack worked overtime keeping the
                opposition strikers at bay, James and Lioda did a mountain of work in the
                midfield in both attack and defence and Jaiden was superb, making himself
                available all over the park.
                <br/><br/>
                In a game where everyone played at a high standard, it was difficult to
                select a player of the match. The selection panel looked for that little
                something that stood out and as a result congratulations to Connor for a
                brilliant game and even more brilliant pull-back that bamboozled the
                opposition and got our team going forward - well deserved!
                <br/><br/>
                Thanks to our coach and managers on the day as well. Their job wasn't an
                easy one having to co-ordinate to squads with little time to prepare. They
                were also able to make sure that the players all had fun... and that's
                what really counts.

                A lovely Saturday morning at Carlingford and the Under 8 Blue team were revved
                up for a big game against the Macquarie Dragons having had to endure the pain
                of a bye in round one. A vocal support group of parents, relatives and friends
                were in attendance to add that extra atmosphere to what was shaping as a great
                day.
                <br/><br/>
                Referee Pauline C blew her whistle for the commencement and the combined
                bottled up energies were released with gusto! Excellent passing, dribbling,
                kicking to free space, passing, shooting and tackling the ball were all on display.
                <br/><br/>
                Tom H was safe as houses in defence making some great goal-saving tackles
                and fantastic passes to his team mates. Eli who was keen to keep goal in the
                first half made some great saves, goal kicks to his mates and some really
                excellent 'W' kicks to free space. A feature of our play was our passing game
                and David, Adam and Charlie really dribbled and passed the ball well. Who would
                have guessed that Jack was playing his first ever game? He trapped and passed
                like a seasoned pro, well done Jack. Tom O and Christopher made some great tackles
                that helped keep the Macquarie Dragons scoreless in the first half. Rhea made an
                excellent pull-back and some great kicks to free space. Patrick and Shannon showed
                wonderful skill with their long passing and general kicking game.
                <br/><br/>
                A special word of thanks to all the parents, family and friends who made
                the trip out to Carlingford, you really helped to make it a great day.
                <br/><br/>
                See you all at training!

                Glenhaven made the first attempt at goal. Jared made the first of several
                successful saves. North Ryde rose to the occasion, an improved game from
                the previous week. The boys played well in their respective positions. Our
                defence was strong. The first goal for North Ryde was set up by a pass from
                Aymon to Alex and Frazer scoring the goal. Glenhaven levelled the score to
                one-all from a penalty goal. North Ryde were dazzled with a colourful card!
                Regardless, spirits were high and overall a good game to watch. Possession
                of the ball was around 50/50.
                <br/><br/>
                The second goal to North Ryde was a result of great passing. Alex took the
                ball down the line and then passed to Ryan then to Isaac and finally to
                Frazer who scored the goal. We were 2-1 in the final minutes of the game.
                Play was in our half and a Glenhaven player came down in the penalty box
                of his own accord. Alas, a direct penalty kick was given to Glenhaven and
                the score was equalized just prior to the final whistle. Great play boys,
                keep up the good work! Player of the match went to Frazer.

                It was a bright, sunny day at Meadowbank Park. Everyone in the team was
                ready to play the West Ryde Rovers on a good pitch. It was our first match,
                so we were a bit rusty after having the first week off. Nathan and Lewis started
                on the bench as we started the game off well, with our backs Luke, Ben, James
                and Elia moving the ball up front to the forwards, myself (Cameron) and Arman.
                The centres, Tom, Zac, Kyle and Hayden were doing their job, getting first to
                the ball and pushing forward. This finally paid off when I took a corner kick
                that the keeper couldn't keep out. One goal to nil to the newly named
                <span class="bold">North Ryde Nitros!</span>
                <br/><br/>
                The game pretty much continued this way after the first goal of the match, but
                the Rovers were getting hungrier for the ball. However, this was countered with
                some good goal keeping by Lachy. We took advantage of this with a breakaway by
                myself, nearly offside, and took a shot which made it's way into the back of
                the West Ryde Rover's goal. 2-0!
                <br/><br/>
                After the second goal we kept playing with high spirits until the whistle
                blew for half time. The score was 2-0 at the break.
                <br/><br/>
                The second half was much more entertaining, with the Rovers coming back after
                the interval pumped up. Coach Paul made two changes; Lewis replaced Lachy in
                the goals and Nathan came on for Elia. But the Rovers came out hungry for the
                ball and were playing well, spreading the ball wide and creating opportunities.
                Suddenly they found a gap in the North Ryde defence and scored, despite Lewis'
                great effort to save it. The score was then 2-1.
                <br/><br/>
                Again West Ryde were threatening our side of the field. They were the dominant
                team during this period and scored again by splitting open the North Ryde
                defence. We were locked at two-all. Game on.
                <br/><br/>
                We fought harder for the ball but the Rovers were too strong for us to be
                able to create any opportunities. About 3 minutes from time one of their best
                players once again split open the Nitro's defence and scored, to our dismay.
                The Rovers had fought back valiantly after being 2-0 down at half time. All
                in all it was a very tough match but we learnt a lot from it. The game ended
                3-2 to the Rovers. Everyone put in their best effort but there can only be
                one man of the match. Lewis played brilliantly in the goalmouth with some
                brilliant saves and earned the player of the match award.

                Ok, ok, the team's name has officially been changed from
                <span class="wildcats">Wildcats</span> with an
                <span class="wildcats">'s'</span> to <span class="wildcats">Wildcatz</span>
                with a <span class="wildcats">'z'</span> because of increasing pressure from
                Milly, Tess, the girls and their mums. Milly said it would add flair, panache
                and uniqueness. I couldn't imagine it making them play any better, but being
                outnumbered and with a threat of being ostracised, how can you resist! Tess
                keeps saying it's all about being a team, so now that we all agree, let's get
                into the story... sorry match report.
                <br/><br/>
                Week two, and with a little bit of luck and wet weather closing some ovals at
                Morrison Bay we were back at North Ryde, on home turf. Not bad, two home games
                and in front of our own cheer squad. Fifteen minutes prior to kick-off we were
                starting to become concerned with the lack of numbers. Stella, still sick with
                some dreaded illness, Gaelyn & Bhenita on holiday, and no Amany or Rokayah,
                and no Tess either! Hopefully the name change to
                <span class="wildcats">'z'</span> hadn't been short for snooze.
                <br/><br/>
                Panic was really setting in when Rokayah and Amany finally arrived to make
                up just ten players on the park. Ten against Putney Rangers who had won 4 - 0
                the previous week. Panic, panic, panic! 'Axe' (Mia's Dad) placed the girls
                into their positions. Emma up front, Leeanna, Paula, Ellen and Amany, backs.
                <br/><br/>
                Rokayah had been off school all week because of illness and Mum wasn't too
                keen to have her running around all day, so she took up keeper's position
                for the first half. Stefanie, Jemma, Mia & Karagh filled in the midfield
                and Paula, captain.
                <br/><br/>
                The whistle blew and they were into it, the girls holding their own and even
                dominating the game with their now familiar attacking play. Just two minutes
                into the game and Jemma fired one in. Three minutes later and Jemma got her
                second. Shortly afterwards Mia scored two quick goals which was hopefully
                the start of a prolific goal-scoring career. Up 4 - 0 at half time and the
                game wasn't looking very even. Had Putney not brought along the same girls
                that they had used in last week's game? It was time to mix the
                <span class="wildcats">Wildcatz</span> around a bit!
                <br/><br/>
                While its always nice to win, its not just about winning. Its about having
                fun and sharing the experience, and that applies to both teams, not just the
                team that wins. It's about wanting to play next week and the week after, its
                about feeling you have played as well as you can and contributed your best
                to the team on the day. Is it really more fun to win by 10 goals than it is
                to win by 4? I know it wouldn't be much fun to lose by 10!
                <br/><br/>
                Back to the game. At half-time Tess gathered the girls for a quick pep talk.
                "Wow! 4 - 0 with only 10 players, that's awesome, I'm so happy" said Tess.
                With only two weeks to get to know the girls and watch their combined ability,
                Tess and the parents are still amazed at their attacking style and level of
                skills.
                <br/><br/>
                With Rokayah itching to get on the field (no, that wasn't the illness she
                had for the last two weeks), "Who wants to go in goals?" was the question.
                Emma, our little dynamo, queen of push-and-shove, jumped in with "I will".
                Ok, done.
                <br/><br/>
                Rokayah went up front, and everybody else kept their same first-half
                positions. "We're going to mix you up so don't get upset!". There was a tug
                on my shirt from Ellen: "Dave, don't put me forward, I only like being a
                back". "Ok, that's all right, don't worry".
                <br/><br/>
                The second half began and the <span class="wildcats">Wildcatz</span> were
                right up in Putney's penalty box. Even with our goal scorers being moved
                to the back line it was madness. The girls, trying again and again to slot
                one in. Leeanna, Daff, Amany, Paula and Rokayah all just missing by the
                smallest of margins to score. Midway into the half, Karagh was able to score
                her first goal for the season and Putney, straining under the continuous
                bombardment, conceded an own goal shortly afterwards.
                <br/><br/>
                Rokayah's Mum and Dad were on the sideline for her first competition game
                and Mohammad, a very accomplished player, was eagerly giving advice on
                positional play. It went something like "Rokayah stop running around
                everywhere, move up there, stop running. Rokayah stop running, you're so
                stubborn, you're just like your mother". Not sure how Mohammad got home after
                the game, he might have decided to jog, just to keep his fitness level up?
                <br/><br/>
                A 6 - 0 win was a fantastic result considering most of the girls were placed
                in unfamiliar positions by the end of the game in an attempt to slow the
                scoring spree. What it did reveal was the depth of talent, natural athleticism
                and skill that the girls have. I was impressed with the willingness of the
                girls to change positions even though they initially may have felt
                uncomfortable. By the end of the game, just to mention a few, Ellen had moved
                from her new-found favourite back position to midfield, Amany played back,
                mid and forward with relative ease after saying "I don't know what to do",
                while Jemma and Lee had changed positions with each other, attacking mid
                and sweeper switched without affecting the balance of the team. It does show
                real player depth. I must also mention Daff, who played one of her best games
                in seasons, dazzling us with pull-backs and fakes, never taking a backward
                step and getting involved at every opportunity.
                <br/><br/>
                Congratulations to captain Paula for leading her team on the day. Paula has
                displayed a natural ability and skill to read the game, allowing her to shut
                down any attempt by the opposition to move the ball forward. If its not with
                a powerful clearance kick which usually puts the ball back near the
                opposition's penalty box, its a well timed and weighted pass to a team mate
                in free space.
                <br/><br/>
                It was another very exciting game for the girls to tune their soccer skills.
                I know they enjoyed it just as much as the parents because of the victory
                chant and smiling faces at full time. I don't know about everybody else, but
                seven days before I get to watch the <span class="wildcats">Wildcatz</span>
                play their next game just seems too long to wait!

                <br/><br/>
                In the first 15 minutes of play it seemed North Ryde would have no problem
                disposing of WPH and sending them back north. Pierre and Manu had 3 shots on
                goal as did others; it seemed WPH had a magnet drawing the ball away from
                every shot Nth Ryde delivered. The midfield controlled the ball perfectly and
                delivered the ball with pinpoint accuracy to the forwards. Against the run of
                play, WPH had a shot on goal which was brilliantly saved by Agro. Firgal and
                Ado were like a brick wall, never allowing WPH to break North Ryde defensive
                line.
                <br/><br/>
                Nil all at half time which could have easily been 3-0 to North Ryde.
                <br/><br/>
                <span class="underline">Second half highlights</span>
                <br/><br/>
                Very early on, WPH scored from a cross. Higgo and Bruce continually tried
                desperately to protect the line that WPH were trying to infiltrate. Finally
                a break, Bruce had control of the ball with a perfect run up the sideline
                which he crossed to Flocko. Flocko got boot to ball which deflected onto a
                WPH player's hand in the square; the referee had no choice but to give North
                Ryde a penalty. Col, under extreme pressure, had the keeper save a great ball
                which deflected but unfortunately could not be converted by Mark M. North Ryde
                persisted, the pace was frantic, the play needed to slow to the mature age
                fellows' pace. North Ryde once again composed the play and continually remained
                in WPH's half but without success. Shots on goal were the order of the day as
                the sun began to set on North Ryde Oval. With pressure on WPH, 3 cards were
                awarded in what became a fiery match. This seemed to rattle North Ryde and a
                second goal was scored by WPH against the run of play. The replacements came
                thick and fast but unfortunately the goal scoring eluded North Ryde. That first
                win of the season still evades North Ryde but I can sense a change in the air!
