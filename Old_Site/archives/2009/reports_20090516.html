                The Purple team showed encouraging signs this week, with a lot more focus on the game
                play. The game started with a brilliant goal save by <span class="bold">Lucas</span>
                - he chased the ball as it was heading to the goal and saved it with only cms left.
                Great effort! All of the team were much more focused today on trying to block the
                opponent's goals - many successful too. Birthday boy <span class="bold">Jayden</span>
                showed wonderful improvement today - he was on fire! <span class="bold">Jayden</span>
                arrived with great enthusiasm to play, followed the ball around and had some great
                defensive kicks of the ball. <span class="bold">Lukah</span> and
                <span class="bold">Jasmine</span> were good on defence today, with a member of our
                cheersquad, <span class="bold">Brian</span> (the dog), racing in to give a hand.
                Some mid game sledging from the opposition threatened the joy of the game, but we
                overcame it and had a great time. <span class="bold">Will</span> &
                <span class="bold">Cameron</span> were great team players passing the ball. Once
                again, the team dance moves after the goal scores were groovin'&nbsp;

                On a morning that was more suited to being curled up in a warm bed than at a windy cold
                soccer park, our team were looking sharp and enthusiastic in warm up and with the arrival
                of the new playing shirts certainly looked the part and were ready to play.
                <br/><br/>
                Running into what could best be described as an icy gale in the first half, the game
                started at a good pace with some solid work in the midfield from <span class="bold">Jake</span>
                and <span class="bold">Ben</span> ensuring that our opponents did not get the ball into free
                space. As the half wore on and the wind started to take its toll on our players, the game
                started to open up and <span class="bold">Emma</span> and <span class="bold">Dominic</span>
                found themselves doing a lot of chasing with our skilful opponents capitalising on the better
                of the conditions.
                <br/><br/>
                We managed to create a couple of good scoring opportunities in the first half with
                <span class="bold">Felix</span> in particular getting heavily involved and clearly playing
                his best game of the season so far. <span class="bold">Erin</span> was instrumental in making
                sure that all our restarts from the goal line and half way line put us in an advantageous
                position, but unfortunately our opponents were full of running.
                <br/><br/>
                Half time had arrived but all was not with many of the experts on the sideline agreeing
                that it was at least a 10 to 12 goal 'breeze'! As luck would have it as soon as the second
                half commenced, so the wind disappeared.
                <br/><br/>
                It was obvious we were playing a pretty talented team but it didn't seem to worry our guys
                who really went up a notch and started to hold their own. <span class="bold">Dominic</span>
                started to create some scoring chances whilst always being there in defence with his
                trademark 'sweeping' tackles. <span class="bold">Emma</span> was terrific setting up some
                nice moves out wide and still chasing everything in sight. <span class="bold">Ben</span>
                and <span class="bold">Jake</span> were always in amongst the thick of the action where
                the hard yards are done in midfield and <span class="bold">Felix</span> continued to play
                out of his skin, relishing any chance to get involved. <span class="bold">Erin</span> was
                again terrific in finding her team mates with some accurate kicking which earned her the
                Player of the Match trophy for this week&nbsp;
                <img class="top noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_thumbs_up.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                All in all, considering the obvious talent of our opponents, our team never gave up and
                even started to play a better brand of football in the second half when it would have been
                easy to just drop their heads and give up. Coach Chris, whilst still having a bit of work
                to do has managed to blend this team together extremely well so far and the signs of more
                improvement are very encouraging. It's only early days, but the most important thing of all,
                especially at this age, is that all the players are having a lot of fun and are enjoying
                each other's company.
                <br/><br/>
                Looking forward to next week.

                season. The Saints came out hard from the 1st whistle, putting in three quick goals
                and our boys on the back foot.
                <br/><br/>
                Troy, Alex C and Alex W were all working hard in defence, and held out a number of
                attacks. Arlen, Aden and Alex G played a lot more in the mid field, trying to drive
                some ball forward, but the Saints defence was very strong.
                <br/><br/>
                In the 2nd half, after a good chat in the break, our boys got their composure and
                played some better soccer. Arlen got our only goal, and the highlight was we were able
                to keep the Saints to one goal as well.
                <br/><br/>
                Our 'Best Ball  Skills' certificate went to Aden with Troy taking out the 'Best Team
                Player' certificate. The best all rounder trophy went to Alex W.
                <br/><br/>
                Here's hoping this rain breaks and we can get in another great round this week end&nbsp;

                Wow, what a game! It had everything today. New uniforms, sweat, tears (from the
                parents), great defence, great attack, some own goals even blood and finally what
                we were all waiting for, a...
                <br/><br/>
                <span class="bold red">GGGGGGGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLL !!</span>
                <br/><br/>
                Well to start off with it was a wind swept day playing on top of what must have been
                a mountain. Let me tell you it was cold enough. Not a problem for the boys. First
                thing for the day were the presenting of new uniforms and this alone lifted their
                spirits.
                <br/><br/>
                Game on. We started strongly but we were playing a very good team. We let some goals
                in but the boys were still trying their best and that's what it's all about. We made
                a couple of breaks down the side but just couldn't put in the final blow. First half
                we came so close about 4 times but only due to brilliant defence by the other team
                were we denied. Coach and parents new we were on the edge of a great moment. First
                half over and still no score but the coach pulled the boys aside for an encouraging
                word and he gave them the magic oranges. They were pumped.
                <br/><br/>
                Second half started and we let in some easy goals and again we were denied by
                brilliant defence but not for long. Suddenly Jarrod, makes a break up the middle,
                he's in the clear, he does the final kick and it slams into the back of the net&nbsp;
                <img class="top noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_thumbs_up.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                The crowd goes wild, the boys are high fiving, almost brings a tear to the eye just
                writing this. Still the game is not over. We let in a few more goals but the defence
                and commitment from our boys is fantastic. On the line and the opposition is peppering
                the goals and we are keeping it out when suddenly a high ball comes in and is stopped
                brilliantly by one of our boys with his head. This draws blood but after an encouraging
                word from dad and the coach he is fine.
                <br/><br/>
                All in all a great game. They are starting to string together passes and everyone
                is doing there best and more importantly the goals have started to come our way.
                What a game!
                <br/><br/>
                Encouragement award for the week went to Alex for getting in the thick of it. Well
                done Alex and well done North Ryde.

                Saturday proved to be a tough day at the office for the North Ryde U8 White team. To
                start with we were missing <span class="bold">Salim</span> who was hit with the flu
                and then came out against a North Epping team who had the wind advantage in the first
                half and got a lead that we couldn't turn around.
                <br/><br/>
                The was no shortage of effort and with a bit more training and team work the first win
                of the season is just around the corner. <span class="bold">James</span>, at goalie in
                the first half, had plenty of work to do with the opposition making most of the attacking
                play.
                <br/><br/>
                Everyone showed plenty of courage to get back on defence with <span class="bold">Zane</span>
                leading the way. <span class="bold">Hayley</span> and <span class="bold">Lioda</span>
                were in the thick of it as usual and can more than mix it with the boys&nbsp;

                great gorilla saves. <span class="bold">Conner</span>, <span class="bold">Christian</span>,
                <span class="bold">Will</span> and <span class="bold">Austin</span> ran themselves to a
                standstill on defence up against a very good opposition side.
                <br/><br/>
                Player of the day was a tough choice this week with everyone putting in a huge effort
                but in the end it went to <span class="bold">Zane</span> with his fancy footwork and

                What a spirited performance by the U9 Div 1's on Saturday, making the long haul to
                Kenthurst all that more worth the while. The game was an action-packed contest from
                the word go that saw the momentum of the game shift continuously from one side of the
                field to the other, and which left me in my capacity as part-time linesman exhausted
                by the end of it all&nbsp;
                <img class="top noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_frowning.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                Pauline started off proceedings with some strategic field placings and rallied the players
                with a customary pep talk before sending them out onto the battlefield. The ref blew his
                whistle and it was game on, North Ryde and Kenthurst matching each other step for step,
                each side finding as many opportunities to control the midfield and run at goal as they
                were pushed back and forced to defend their own. Jack worked tirelessly on the right
                wing to move the ball upfield, and North Ryde's best opportunity of the first half came
                when Tom Maclean put the Kenthurst defense under pressure and gave Charlie the opportunity
                get the ball into the nets, denied only fractionally by the refs whistle who deemed that
                the ball had gone out of play a split-second before. Close.
                <br/><br/>
                Kenthurst had their fair share of goal attacks and Adam's goal-keeping skills were put to
                the test on at least three occasions, which he handled admirably with a cool and confident
                head to deny Kenthurst a place on the scoreboard. The passing game between Tom Hurst,
                David, Patrick and Shannon was commendable, and turned a Kenthurst attack into well-timed
                North Ryde counter-attack on many occasions. Young Anthony made some timely tackles in the
                midfield to disturb the Kenthurst momentum, and the players always gave a bit more room when
                they sensed Harrison charging in with his big right boot.
                <br/><br/>
                The score remained nil-all at half time, and given the fast pace the game had taken on so
                far it seemed the second half could only belong to the fittest survivors. Field placings
                were adjusted and the team went back into action, urged on by no shortage of motivational
                encouragement from their admiring fans&nbsp;
                <img class="top noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_winking.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                Jett used his speed and strength to keep any Kenthurst midfield attacks in check, and Eli
                and Shannon, bloodhounds on the ball, were merciless in their determination to take the game
                into the danger zone. The fitness and endurance was starting to tell, and even though Jack
                was forced to make some great stops in goal, you could sense that the odds were starting
                to favour the North Ryde momentum.
                <br/><br/>
                David grabbed an opportunity midway in the second half to work his way past a couple of
                players and have a crack at goal, which ricochetted off a defender before finding the back
                of the net. 1 - 0 to North Ryde. The chances at goal were coming think and fast now, but
                hats off to the Kenthurst keeper who was up to the task with some terrific saves. The dry
                ball and dry ground - a first for this season - ensured that the players were able to find
                both height and range with their kicks. Harrison's penalty kick from the halfway line, for
                instance, flew with such speed and force that none of Charlie, Adam, Eli or David were able
                to stop it as it sailed over the goal line, perilously close to Kenthurst's right goalpost.
                <br/><br/>
                North Ryde's second goal came off Tom Maclean's boot in similar fashion. Playing a defensive
                position, we weren't sure whether Tom was having a go at goal or simply trying to put the ball
                back amongst his pack of forwards, but it was launched from within his own half and sailed at
                a perfect trajectory through the air over all the gazing players and over the Kenthurst
                keeper's fingertips into the back of the nets, taking the score to 2 - 0 and effectively
                sealing the win&nbsp;
                <img class="top noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_thumbs_up.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                It was another strong team effort from the Div 1's, combined with some terrific ball control
                and an ever-improving passing game, not to mention their fitness levels which always see them
                going as hard at it in the first minute as they are in the last. You always sense that they
                still have a lot left in them, and we look forward to seeing more of it as the season unfolds.

                A windy day greeted the teams for the local derby between North Ryde and the West Ryde
                Rovers. The crosswind ensured anything directed towards the eastern touchline gained
                extra momentum and provided anxious moments for the goalkeepers.
                <br/><br/>
                The first half started with the Rovers camped in North Ryde's half with Oscar as
                goalkeeper extinguishing any attacking raid by their forwards. With the Rovers
                employing an offside trap our forwards relied upon their speed in counter attack.
                <br/><br/>
                <img class="imgtopleft noborder" src="images/photos/u9/20090516_u9_div4_2.jpg">
                Rhea, Ryan and Hamish all made breaks. An injury to Sam saw him carried from field,
                but once he was cleared of any serious injury Sam bravely returned in the 2nd half
                to support his team. A close offside call and other forward raids with stray passes
                meant the Rovers didn't have it all their own way.
                <br/><br/>
                The first half finished 0-0 so it was up to coaches Scott and Allan to plan a way to
                end the deadlock. The 2nd half started with North Ryde improving their possession with
                running out of defence and employing short passes, which made for some anxious moments.
                <br/><br/>
                Thomas S, Matthew and Satya all repelled the Rovers attacks until a pass found its mark
                and got Rhea in space. Beating 3 defenders with pace and footwork she slotted the ball
                past the goalkeeper... GOAL!&nbsp;

                A more desperate Rovers team now replied with breaks of their own including a two-on-one
                situation with our goalie Liam managing to force a mistake which saw the final pass go
                wide... groans and oohs from the vocal crowd on the western sideline.
                <br/><br/>
                Another raid saw an aerial shot on goal just miss the left hand post as our goalkeeper
                was left squinting into the sun. The midfield of Peter, Ryan and Thomas O were now extra
                defenders maintaining closer marking of the ballplayer preventing any free flowing game
                for the Rovers as they pressed for the equaliser.
                <br/><br/>
                Finally the ref's whistle blew and the suspense was over. North Ryde had prevailed
                in a tight game. Good effort!&nbsp;

                Was I the only one who got the family packed up in the car and commenced the trek down
                the M2 to James Henty, only to realise that for once, we were playing a little closer
                to the eastern seaboard? It seemed like all of our Saturdays would be spent traveling
                west. What a nice change to be much closer to home.
                <br/><br/>
                As usual our energetic team took to the field full of enthusiasm. <span class="bold">Lucy</span>
                grabbed the keeper's kit for the first half and made some excellent saves and w-kicks.
                <span class="bold">Julian</span> and <span class="bold">Tim</span> were more than solid
                at the back and made some great defensive moves that helped keep the scoreline
                respectable. <span class="bold">Josh</span> helped out well at the back making an
                excellent pull-back.
                <br/><br/>
                <span class="bold">Maggie</span> and <span class="bold">Ben</span> were busy up front
                and both ran themselves ragged. <span class="bold">Christopher</span> and
                <span class="bold">Saxon</span> were everywhere it seemed, well done guys.
                <span class="bold">Tom</span> & <span class="bold">Massie</span> both made some great
                dribbling runs and <span class="bold">Benyad</span> was his usual cool calm self,
                passing and dribbling well.
                <br/><br/>
                <span class="bold">Luke</span> took the gloves from Lucy in the second half and kept
                goal really well making many courageous saves. A special mention to Player of the Match
                <span class="bold">Brooke</span>. She was fantastic. Given the amount of running you

                The boys were always going to be facing an uphill battle in this game with absence of
                two key team members through illness reducing the squad to 10 available players and no
                substitutes available from the Under 14 side. However we packed our picnic lunches and
                survival gear and headed off to Annangrove with Tim Greer from the under 13 side coming
                along to make up the numbers.
                <br/><br/>
                Although the team lost 5-nil on the day, they played determinedly for the whole 70
                minutes against an opposition who took any opportunity to get in a cheap sly shot,
                elbowing, stamping on feet in close marking situations etc, our boys can be proud of
                the fact that they did not retaliate in kind&nbsp;
                <img class="top noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_thumbs_up.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                Coach Barry Alchin was pleased with improvements in the area of marking up on players
                and the way defenders held their shape catching the opposition in offside positions
                on numerous occasions. While the backs particularly LiamT and Leo W did their job
                admirably and William Greer once again kept strongly denying several scoring opportunities,
                the forwards despite creating scoring chances could not find the back of the opposition net.
                <br/><br/>
                The boys trailed only 2-0 at half time but once again the shortage of players and fresh
                replacements saw the team tire and concede 3 second half goals including a penalty. Heads
                up boys you played strongly and as Barry pointed out there are improvements in key areas
                each week. A special thanks to Tim Greer who backed up from the Under 13 game in his first
                season of football to help the team out on the day.

                <span class="italic">We just blew in from the windy city; the windy city is mighty
                pretty</span>. Well it was feeling like a windy Chicago day at Pidding Park. It's
                very hard to write the report and hold onto the paper!
                <br/><br/>
                The toss would be important today as there was obviously a definite wind advantage.
                Browny was under the weather and the only missing face for Nth Ryde. It's quite
                funny watching the old boys line up as they seem to have as many players on the
                field as off! It was a quiet start; the boys learnt early that short passes would
                work a lot better for them. Mark H and Smithy were working hard in the backs, but
                unfortunately against the run of play WPH - Cherrybrook Blue snuck in an early goal.
                The boys looked dumbfounded; I think it was a case of 'weren't you marking him?'!
                Restart and Nth Ryde decided it was time to play, the pressure was applied & a
                corner was awarded. Pommie put a nice ball in but the wind played havoc with it.
                It didn't amount to anything. Mark VH then put a great ball through but the pushy
                WPH - Cherrybrook Blue keeper elbowed Pierre and had him flying out of the way.
                The ball was sent downfield & Macca returned the favour to a WPH - Cherrybrook
                Blue forward! As with all over 35 games the players still think they're playing
                premier league! A yellow card was then issued to a WPH - Cherrybrook Blue player
                for an indiscretion and not long after Matt S was taken out badly&nbsp;
                <img class="top noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_angry.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                Play continued and Firgs had a lovely cross over the goal which the wind almost
                helped in. Play moved up and down the field, Pommie had a lovely little bit of
                flair up the sideline but was stopped short. Time for some SUPER SUBS! The big
                guns were coming on - Ado, where are you? In the meantime WPH - Cherrybrook Blue
                snuck in another cheeky goal from some poor marking by Nth Ryde. Scrappy play
                continued until Nth Ryde applied the pressure. Mark VH took a throw in to Carl
                who placed the ball back to Firgs. From 30 metres out Firgs hit it and the keeper
                just touched it with his fingertips but could not save was to be the goal of the
                season so far. 2-1 WPH - Cherrybrook Blue. Nth Ryde then had a few more attempts
                but to no avail. The boys were starting to pass, call and mark better. The half
                time whistle blew to halt any further progress or should I say damage?! Darren
                was very vocal about marking and composure at the half time chat. Would the boys
                be able to apply what he has asked?
                <br/><br/>
                <span class="underline">Second Half</span>
                <br/><br/>
                Nth Ryde seemed to be playing better football at the start of the second half.
                Firgs had been watching his beloved Chelsea play and thought he would take his
                chance again from 30 metres out. This time he found the post & the ball rebounded
                onto the field. Firgs definitely had his golden boot on today! Nth Ryde then had
                to scramble to defend. Col, Ado and Firgs were working hard to not let WPH -
                Cherrybrook Blue penetrate the goals again. There was a lot of pushing going on
                that saw many Nth Ryde players taking tumbles. Nth Ryde then had a couple of
                shots on goal that didn't miss by much. Carl was having a good game up front
                and was well supported by Matt S and Mark VH in the midfield. Pommie was as ever
                entertaining to say the least! More SUPERSUBS!
                <br/><br/>
                Again against the run of play WPH - Cherrybrook Blue scored. The mistakes were
                creeping back in again and were costing Nth Ryde dearly. Play was restarted and
                Nth Ryde sent a ball in the air which Smithy (who was playing up front from the
                backs) headed into the goals! 3-2 WPH - Cherrybrook Blue. Smithy - no case for
                you son! Nth Ryde then moved the ball up the field and Pommie had a great run
                up the sideline, he got chopped down from behind and received a penalty. Pommie
                went right and scored. 3-3. From the kickoff Nth Ryde had to defend quickly,
                Agro pulled off an almighty save to keep the scores level. SUPERSUB time again,
                time for the hardworking Mark H to have a rest!
                <br/><br/>
                Carl then had a shot on goal which the keeper saved & rebounded to Pierre; the
                terrier chased the ball down and sent it into the back of the net! 4-3 Nth Ryde.
                The boys were playing much better, could they hold on for a win? The boys began
                playing their hearts out, everyone had come to the sideline to offer their 2
                cents worth, Flock was controlling the halves well - hang on he's not playing
                anymore! Full time, woohoo, well done boys, you're climbing the ladder to that
                35/2 premiership again!&nbsp;
