                Apprehensively, we all set off to Magdala in the morning, with only some of the
                fields open. We were perplexed as to why, as our field was really muddy, but alas
                the Purples soldiered on.
                <br/><br/>
                Once the team got permission from the cheersquad to run in the mud, they found great
                delight in seeing it spotted over themselves.
                <br/><br/>
                The rain lightly set in and some of the team were a bit apprehensive to continue on...
                some players dancing in the rain entertained us... but then it just bucketed down.
                The game was stopped early and the muddy soaked players scattered to the nearest cars.

                Twice in a row Martin got the trophy. In the second half we got three goals and
                they only got one goal. At half time it rained and it was fun. We danced in the

                The boys ran straight onto the field. Despite the drizzle they were keen and their
                eyes were wide. They were excited, and it showed. There was a number of incidents
                involving deliberate movements into the large pools of mud on the ground, and a bit
                of pushing and shoving. They came back to us covered in mud with big smiles on their
                faces. Then we decided that we would like to play some soccer.&nbsp;

                <br/><br/>
                Thanks to our training squad mates Daniel and Jasmine for making sure we had the
                numbers to play. They were both on their second super-soaked match of the day. Angus
                was also keen despite an ankle injury slowing him down to about half his normal pace.
                <br/><br/>
                The game started slowly while both our team and the Gladesville Ravens got used to
                the sluggish conditions. The Ravens played a strong team game, and managed to score
                a couple of goods goals in a row. There was a lot of movement up and down the ground
                from both sides, with William keen to get to any ball that went into the puddles.
                Daniel came close to scoring, but at half time the Ravens were still ahead. Oranges
                under umbrellas were still good, slightly less soggy than the mud in which they were
                eaten.
                <br/><br/>
                The second half started well, and was quite an evenly matched session. NRS was looking
                much stronger, with a few goods runs toward the goals by Henry and Daniel. Jasmine
                belted a few line-kicks well into goal territory. Angus was vigilant in defence and
                put his already sore leg in the way of a solid Raven's goal kick attempt (bravo). A
                few minutes into second half Raphael scored a most awesome goal from about half-way
                down the field.&nbsp;
                <img class="top noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_thumbs_up.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                Soon afterwards it started to rain heavily, and the end of the game was called.
                A shame, as I had the distinct feeling that our team was coming back for a strong
                finish. Nonetheless, a good muddy time was had by all. Player of the match was William.

                What an experience! The rain didn't hold the boys back, what great team spirit and
                determination!
                <br/><br/>
                The boys worked really hard defending goals, making great runs and managing the
                ball on the muddy wet grounds.
                <br/><br/>
                A great team effort from all our players (Jarrod, Luke A, Kaiden, Alex, Luke M
                and Jay) all lining Blake up to deliver our well deserved goal. Excellent work
                against a strong team finishing on 3-1.
                <br/><br/>
                Lets keep it up boys... stay pumped... stay focused.... and most of all keep
                having an awesome time.

                Today we arrived at Morrison Bay ready to play the top team Normanhurst Eagles. The
                heavens opened as soon as we arrived... unsure if we were going to play as it was the
                refs call. The boys were wet and cold but very eager to play, and threw their hands
                up in the air when they heard it was game on.
                <br/><br/>
                The whistle blew and we were off. The rain started to ease a little. Shannon our
                keeper had many great saves but finally after many attempts Normanhurst managed to
                score. The boys ran hard all game in the wet and muddy conditions. They were down
                1 - 0 at the break but came out firing in the second half.
                <br/><br/>
                A well executed kick from our 2nd-half keeper Jack saw both the ball and his right
                boot soar through the air with great height and speed&nbsp;

                Adam's footwork was fantastic sending the ball in all the right places. We had many
                attempts at goals and if it wasn't for the huge mud batch in front of the Normanhurst
                goals we may have scored a goal or two... talk about getting stuck in the mud.
                <br/><br/>
                Our defence was strong, including a super header from our champion back Tom H, who
                never lets too many balls get past him. He will be missed as he jetsets overseas
                soon. Have a great time Tom & family.&nbsp;

                All boys lifted their game in the second half. It was an exciting game to watch, and
                definitely worth getting wet for.
                <br/><br/>
                Hopefully see you all at training, weather permitting!

                Despite the rain our team were keen and they were ready to have fun. Our team was
                <img class="imgleft noborder" src="images/photos/u9/20090620_u9_div4_2.jpg">
                soon put under a lot of pressure as the Hawks had scored an early goal.
                <br/><br/>
                They worked really hard defending goals, making great runs and managing the ball
                on the muddy wet grounds.
                <br/><br/>
                Soon it was half time and the Hawks led by 4-0 (1 was scored accidentally by our
                own player).
                <br/><br/>
                The rain was easing at second half and there was apparent resurgence of the team
                due to tips from the coach. The players passed the ball between them and moved the
                ball into the opposition's half.
                <br/><br/>
                The final score was 5-0 but the game was a lot closer.

                Wow, what a muddy wet day it was for a game of soccer on Saturday!
                <br/><br/>
                It was the perfect situation for a new advertisement for Napisan to be filmed. With
                a change in grounds where play was permitted, our intrepid squad (both players and
                <img class="imgleft noborder" src="images/photos/u9/20090620_u9_div6_2.jpg">
                parents) took off to Morrison 1 to perform their most exciting version of mud sports.&nbsp;

                <br/><br/>
                The boys' eyes gleamed with excitement at the prospect whilst the girls were slightly
                indifferent however still so keen for a run.
                <br/><br/>
                First half saw Ben in goals doing a sterling job, with great pressure on in his half.
                <br/><br/>
                Thomas threw himself around the paddock and took every opportunity for the 'slide'
                in brilliant defence, as did Chris. I'm sure both boys enjoyed the slalom immensely.
                <br/><br/>
                <img class="imgtopright noborder" src="images/photos/u9/20090620_u9_div6_3.jpg">
                With Massie on attack and Benyad in defence, the Cina team was powering. Brooke was
                thoroughly enjoying our game against her cousin who I might add is even taller than
                Brooke!
                <br/><br/>
                Lucy forgot about getting dirty and threw herself in to defence and attack with Tim
                having an excellent game with his persistence.
                <br/><br/>
                The score was nil all at half time with rain falling steadily. Great team effort from
                Kim, Tony and Annie to keep the timing on track, which allowed all the players to
                only be off for a few minutes each.
                <br/><br/>
                Brooke was in goal during second half and did one of our teams greatest saves using
                her height and leaping like a gazelle. Maggie had several great runs down the side as
                striker and Luke was in there with boots, mud and all&nbsp;

                <br/><br/>
                Despite many attempts at goals from both sides the game was a nil all draw which was a
                great result given the conditions. Well done team and you are doing so well remembering
                the off-side rule and listening to your coach.

                North Ryde Nachos (the favourites for this match) were pumped up for a win. However,
                Glenhaven were not going to back down that easily. Looking a bit like rain, the
                weather was not going to get to both teams.

                North Ryde ready to go with Captain Hayden leading them out to the pitch have a
                rusty start with a few very close chances. In about the first 10 minutes it started
                raining, this was no longer just a soccer game but a swimming carnival as well, both
                teams not letting their guard down. Kyle and Elia running flat out on the wings. The
                backs - Ben, Chris, Lewis, Luke, Tim and Que one - were rock hard - great work guys.
                The mids Hayden and Daniel were very controlling. Our striker Eman had some good
                chances and our goalie Nate played well in tough conditions. Despite the effort the
                score had remained 0-0.

                Rain, Rain, Rain, go away... Mark H said 'How many kilos of rain is there?'. The
                Nachos hungrier than ever (no, not for nachos!) were determined to score even in
                these torrential conditions. Their chance came. A perfect corner from Lewis straight
                to Hayden and his foot connects. Goal, 1-0! Pumped up, North Ryde were determined to
                score again. Another chance, Kyle runs up the wing, bends it like Burnard, a shot
                from the side of the goals... he scores! Goal, 2-0! Even more difficult since the
                rain had made it impossible to kick. Trying to make a powerful kick in the goal mouth
                Lewis kicks, deflected. Hayden kicks, deflected. Kyle kicks, in! 3-0 the final score
                and it is all over, the Nachos win.
                <br/><br/>
                Coach Paul is very proud of his team! Kyle voted Man of the Match. Not just a win
                but a team effort and a great swimming carnival. Go NACHOS!&nbsp;
