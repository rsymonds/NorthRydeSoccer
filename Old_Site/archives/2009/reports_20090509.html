                It was an early start for all at Magdala. Dad's <span class="bold">Graeme</span> &
                <span class="bold">Dave</span> were in charge of the setting up of the mini's goals
                ... but ... we realised that when the next team arrived that we had the fields running
                sidewards and were half the size!  Not sure if that worked for us or against us? Mum
                <span class="bold">Leanne</span> arrived with the wrong child and had to go home quickly
                to find the other NRS player at her house! Needless to say, the 8:15am timeslot doesn't
                work well for the cheer squad and we had much laughter together over the mornings events.
                <br/><br/>
                Now to the important topic, our little Purple team. Once again, they raced onto the
                field smiling and excited. The glary sun proved to be a distraction through the game
                to both teams, as players made funny shadow puppets. When the Purple's had the ball, we
                saw much more cooperative play, with passing of the ball to the other team players. The
                team has mastered the new technique of kicking the ball out of play to prevent the other
                team scoring the goal. That ball was flying over the line everywhere - great saves!
                <br/><br/>
                It was a slow start, but the second half brought success, with a kick in from
                <span class="bold">Cameron</span> to <span class="bold">Lukah</span> scoring our goal.
                The team celebrated with high fives all round and dancing. What a beautiful sight seeing
                our preschoolers enjoy the game so much. <span class="bold">Lucas</span> attacked the
                ball well this week, making a couple of goal saves. <span class="bold">Will</span> and
                <span class="bold">Jasmine</span> were great on defence, with <span class="bold">Jayden</span>
                jumping in later as well.
                <br/><br/>
                Great effort everyone!
                <br/><br/>
                Congratulations to the Player of the Week - <span class="bold">Cameron</span>.

                The game was another of two halves, with our boys running in an unanswered five goals
                in the 1st half, and then Putney coming back with two to our three in the 2nd.
                <br/><br/>
                Again Aden was strong up front, pumping in six of our goals He was ably supported by
                Alex W, who got his 1st for the season, and Arlen supported well in the mid field.
                Alex C and Alex G played well both up front and at the back, with some good strong
                line balls up to Aden. Troy, our strength in defence, kept things under control at
                the back.

                The North Ryde team arrived perky and fresh like the sterling Autumn morning we woke
                up to. A couple of the boys, Angus & Ben, had had a big warm up, having already played
                in matches earlier in the morning. The rest of the team were very keen to get stuck in.
                <br/><br/>
                The Hunters Hill All Saints were in fine form and, despite some excellent team work by
                North Ryde, quickly found themselves with a 3-0 lead. Their goal kick up the sidelines
                found its way into the Hunters Hill goal once again, and North Ryde were looking at an
                almost insurmountable 4-0 disadvantage.
                <br/><br/>
                A quick word from Coach Wayne and Manager Bill and the team spread out and some amazing
                field defense by William was lovely to watch. A long pass down the side from Raphael
                found its way to Henry and Hugh and GEE!! It was a close shave, but to no avail.
                The boys in orange grouped in and defended their goal too well... the slight downhill
                advantage to Hunter's Hill proved too much and half time saw us sitting at 5-0.
                <br/><br/>
                Manager Bill and Coach Wayne got the team hyped up for the second half and in spite of
                not having any oranges for half time (I can't apologise enough! I hope William recovered
                and got his trip to Macca's?) the team rallied and seemed to be champing to get into
                the second half. Tactics were to spread out, concentrate on where the ball was going,
                and to use the side lines for passing & traveling to the goal end.
                <br/><br/>
                North Ryde now had the downhill advantage and used it. A beautiful, strong & true kick
                in from Hugh resulted in our first goal for the day and you probably heard us cheering
                over the froth of your Cox's Road cappuccino. Play resumed and a very close call after
                a kick-in from Raphael was followed by some lovely passing by Jason. Good defense from
                Angus saved the next goal attempt by Hunters Hill. The ball went straight back down the
                side lines as coached, a lovely pass to Hugh from Henry and YES! Our second goal!
                <br/><br/>
                It was a ding-dong battle after that with play going backwards and forwards. Ben Lau
                came on after being rested (deservedly) and contributed to yet another lovely glide
                down the side lines to Henry who once again passed to Hugh for a tricky goal delicately
                woven through thick Hunters Hill defense. 5-3. Winning could be on the cards...
                <br/><br/>
                Great foot work from Hugh and Henry saved a goal attempt by Hunters Hill, but their
                next one, it has to be said, was a great goal from just under the halfway line. The
                score now 6-3. Our team valiantly battled on and the game finished just as Raphael
                shot a beautiful ball up the near side line.
                <br/><br/>
                Full time score: 6 - 3 to Hunters Hill All Saints - well done everyone.

                This week we saw a much approved effort with a lot more skill shown by all of the
                players. The final score ended up being 4 - 1 to the opposition but didn't reflect
                the effort shown by the North Ryde team.
                <br/><br/>
                North Ryde dominated the first half with some great attacking play and led at the
                break 1 - 0. <span class="bold">Salim</span> showed he has some real strike power
                with the first goal of the season. We were unlucky not to be leading by more with
                <span class="bold">Hayley</span>, <span class="bold">James</span> and
                <span class="bold">Zane</span> also having shots at goal. <span class="bold">Lioda</span>
                put into practice what she has learnt at training by always finding free space and
                looking for others to pass to. <span class="bold">Jack</span> made some great goal
                saves including one that caught him in the face!!
                <br/><br/>
                This was a game of 2 halves with West Ryde scoring all the 2nd half goals. Our goalie
                <span class="bold">Austin</span> was put under a lot of pressure and but still came
                up with 5 fantastic saves. <span class="bold">Christian</span>,
                <span class="bold">Will</span> and <span class="bold">Connor</span> worked hard on
                defence and kept the score lines even for most of the half.
                <br/><br/>
                Player of the day this week went to <span class="bold">Hayley</span> who was everywhere.
                She set up her team mates with some smart passing and showed she has some great ball
                skills and speed to burn. With a bit more training and working on our passing skills
                and finding space the first win is not far away.

                There are three words to describe today's match... Entertainment! Entertainment!
                Entertainment! With a full team of 12, Jett, Jack & Charlie were first subs and watched
                eagerly from the sideline waiting to get onto the field and get amongst the action.
                <br/><br/>
                We started with good pressure up the front from the strikers Shannon and Eli. Anthony in
                midfield and David in the back combined to push the ball through and create opportunities
                - a corner on this occasion. Eli fed the ball beautifully to Adam who had a strong shot
                at goals, Shannon was in perfect position ready for the 'scraps' but a tidy save by the
                keeper left nothing for him.
                <br/><br/>
                Patrick then had a shot at the goal, Shannon again ready for the 'scraps' had a shot, Adam
                also had a shot but struck the post. Another attempt at goals by Shannon - no luck again
                - we sense it was going to happen soon!
                <br/><br/>
                David fed up the wing with great power and Shannon popped it in the net... Hooray, the
                crowd cheered, we love to watch our team of boys do what they do with thought and passion
                and their combined talents and skills.
                <br/><br/>
                Tom Maclean and Tom Hurst - what an awesome combination to create our defence. An absolute
                pleasure to see these two boys in action! Tom Maclean cleared the ball from the back to
                David in the mid who pushed it up the wing. A back pass wide of the goals from Eli to
                Patrick who passed to Shannon saw another attempt at goals, but the goal post got in the
                way again!
                <br/><br/>
                Harrison was doing a fantastic job in goals using his height and strength to secure the
                goals and solid in defence to take the pressure off the team on many occasions.
                <br/><br/>
                We're up by 1 goal when Glenhaven struck from a corner! More attempts at goal from
                Charlie, Shannon and Eli - the crowd is cheering, what great soccer to watch. Then
                Adam converts! That's 2-1. Patrick is very consistent today and works tirelessly and
                effortlessly in the midfield.
                <br/><br/>
                A quiet start to the second half. Jack and Jett are strikers now and get straight into it.
                Jack takes a great shot across the face of the goal. Jett has a shot but it powered left
                of the post. Adam takes a throw in and Jett puts it into the back of the net - go Jett!
                <br/><br/>
                A tense moment in goals, David clears it... phew! Jack feeds the ball to Jett who runs
                to goal and his shot flies right of the post. Charlie takes a corner, a bit of washing
                machine stuff at the goal front and Jett then converts! Adam takes a throw in, Jack
                takes up to goal, attempt goes straight to goalie... so close!
                <br/><br/>
                The end result was 5-1 and ALL boys played well and enjoyed their soccer today.
                <br/><br/>
                Now that's entertainment!

                What a magnificent day for a game. Holy Cross had drawn with the team that beat us
                6-1 last week so we knew we were in for a tough game.
                <br/><br/>
                <img class="imgtopleft noborder" src="images/photos/u9/20090509_u9_div4_2.jpg">
                Whilst they were "camped out" at our end of the field for most of the first half we
                had limited their chances with some strong defending. It was only an unlucky goal
                from a goal kick just on half time that saw us go in one goal down.
                <br/><br/>
                As the second half got underway our team were all fighting hard for possession but the
                second half was going much the same way as the first & Holy Cross quickly went 4-0 up.
                <br/><br/>
                What happened next was a great sight. North Ryde started throwing caution to the wind
                & threw more players forward.
                <br/><br/>
                Hamish took more of an attacking role from midfield & was causing Holy Cross all sorts
                of problems. With more support Oscar started becoming a nuisance as well.
                <br/><br/>
                Ultimately the attacking paid dividends with North Ryde taking the initiative & Oscar
                & Hamish scoring goals. We were set for an exciting finish but Holy Cross managed to
                hang on for a win.

                What a sparkling day it was on Saturday morning seeing our mighty team back at James
                Henty 2 playing against Hills Hawks. I do believe all of our cars are now on auto pilot
                for this ground. Players and parents were enthusiastic and raring to go when the whistle
                blew. Lucy and Maggie kicked off with some 'striker' girl power and the Hawks flew.
                Swooping on every available ball saw the Hawks attacking over and over in the first
                few minutes with our goalie Julian making save after save.  What pressure he was under
                and how wonderfully he handled it. Saxon was a demon with great defending up the side
                and had a great attempt at goal early on in the first half. Chris was zipping all over
                the place and Benyad , Ben, Josh and Tim were in there boots and all. Alas, the Hawks
                wore our team down to get 2 well-deserved goals in the first half.
                <br/><br/>
                Second half saw our mighty Brooke fly in to action with some terrific defence and taking
                a few tumbles with Massie and Luke backing up and Chris in goal. It was a fast start
                with our strikers closer to the goal and providing some nail-biting times for the
                parents. Much cheering from the sideline as more great saves were made from our second
                half goalie Chris. Massie was unfortunate to miss with a goal attempt and the Hawks
                swooped for another, which brought them to a clear lead. Well done to everyone. You are
                improving every week and starting to really think about your positions. Most importantly
                you are having fun.

                Another fantastic game to watch by our boys. All the team put in for today's
                performance and they were well rewarded with a good win over a strong team (and we
                had no subs again!)
                <br/><br/>
                <span class="bold">Morgan</span> continued to display that never-give-up spirit and
                first-to-the-ball skills. <span class="bold">Cameron</span> remained our solid centre
                back not only defending well but also putting in with strong, long and deep defensive
                kicks away from the goal area. <span class="bold">Matia</span> ran well all game and
                provided good strong defense on the left. <span class="bold">Josh</span> ran all the
                first half on the wing creating plenty of opportunities, as well a being very strong
                in goals in the second half.
                <br/><br/>
                <span class="bold">Christian</span> played a strong, composed game - he is going from
                strength to strength both in the goals and on the pitch. <span class="bold">Alex</span>
                had his first full game in the mids and ran the whole time, covering lots of ground,
                and getting lots of balls through to the forwards. <span class="bold">Jay</span> was
                very strong in both defense and attack all game closing the centre down lots of times
                and putting through some really beautiful balls to forwards as well.
                <br/><br/>
                <span class="bold">Aymon</span> (our man of the match) played very strong, contested
                every ball and really put his strong kicks to the best use. <span class="bold">Lukas</span>
                dazzled us with his footwork and skill on the ball once again.
                <br/><br/>
                <span class="bold">Mitchell</span> and <span class="bold">Jackson</span> brought
                everything together up the front with their best display this year of working together
                - they followed-up on the ball, and had that never-give-up attitude (well done both of you).
                <br/><br/>
                All the boys have been putting a lot of focus and effort into their training and it's
                really nice to see this paying off on the weekends. Well done to everyone, see you on
                Wednesday at training.

                Despite the scoreline this was a very good effort by the team as a whole, with improved
                marker defence and commitment by the whole team.
                <br/><br/>
                Glenhaven got off to a flying start scoring a quick opening goal and jumped to a 2 Nil
                lead before our boys replied with an excellent goal by Tim B to bring the score back
                to a goal difference.
                <br/><br/>
                <img class="imgtopleft noborder" src="images/photos/u15/20090509_u15_div4_2.jpg">
                Our boys then pressed for an equaliser,however a couple of
                blatant missed off side calls by the referee allowed Glenhaven a further 2 goals in
                the first half against the run of play. A further goal to Stephen B-H saw the boys go
                to half time with an undeserved 4 goals to 2 deficit.
                <br/><br/>
                The second half was hard fought and the team held Glenhaven scoreless for the first
                25 minutes of the half until the final 10 minutes when Glenhaven's advantage in fresh
                replacements saw them score a further 3 goals against a tiring team.
                There were some strong efforts by all players on the day, Liam T and Sam B tried
                tirelessly and often turned defence into attack. Jordan C & Regan C both played
                themselves to a standstill and never stopped trying.
                <br/><br/>
                Stephen B-H showed his finishing
                style with a well taken goal. Matt U and Lewis B also played determinely. Leo W once
                again did all that was asked of him in defence and has put in 2 strong games.
                William
                G was solid in goals (despite the scoreline) making several strong saves (17) often
                worrying the attacking team into error by his positive decision making and well timed
                advances to the attacking players, his ball disposal was also first rate.
                <br/><br/>
                Well played boys a win is just around the corner if we have a continued commitment
                toward attendance and attitude toward training.

                With the boys on a winning streak and fairly injury free (aside of the moans and groans
                every Sunday morning), the Nth Ryde boys looked eager and ready to take on and conquer
                the next opposition. The only flaw this week was that Mark Hesse was sporting a very
                nasty case of the flu and Carl was still not 100% ready to run on for a full game.
                <br/><br/>
                The gods had given us a glorious soccer afternoon at Magdala and the crowd was ready
                for an exciting match, West Pennant Hills always play out a good game with Nth Ryde.
                Would Nth be able to give the crowd what they had come for - a win?
                <br/><br/>
                The game started with the usual fast pace, at their age you think the boys would know
                how to handle nerves by now! Nth applied the early pressure and Ando had a meagre shot
                on goal which found the keeper. Hang on - missing child back soon!
                <br/><br/>
                Ok, child located back to the soccer, the game had changed and WPH had the upper hand,
                there was a big shot by the WPH forward which went like a rocket - Agro pulled off a
                great save. WPH then had a corner and immediately another corner as Nth scrambled to
                defend. They did a great job and were soon blasting into the WPH half. The next few
                plays would see some Ronaldo like moments from players such as Ando, and Macca, who
                both thought they could fire rockets at the keeper from 30m out! No luck however for
                both of them as the ball speed was about 90% less than when Ronaldo strikes a ball!
                Col then decided he would join the Ronaldo show and he also found the keeper! You're
                not playing for Man United boys!
                <br/><br/>
                Finally Pierre had a genuine shot on goal which the keeper saved by his fingertips.
                The ensuing corner unfortunately amounted to nothing - no one was waiting in the box!
                The play continued to build until Firgs put a great ball through that Pierre headed,
                the ball fell short and it was a shame that Pommie had bought his two left feet and
                tripped over the ball! Nth Ryde was definitely gaining the upper hand. There was a few
                choice words being exchanged out on the park and Karim got fiery with a very vocal
                player. They both received yellow cards for their efforts and Karim had some time on
                the bench to cool down. Half time 0-0.
                <br/><br/>
                The 2nd half started with only a few changes. Nth continued to have the lion's share
                of possession early, Higgo put a great ball through to the waiting Pierre who put it
                into the back of the net, 1-0 Nth Ryde. Pierre then showed us that his shoulder had
                completely recovered by celebrating the goal with a forward roll! I think he plays
                with his kids too much! Play got underway and Macca then had a WPH player ‘run into
                him', honestly he didn't trip anybody ref! He did receive a yellow card for his
                efforts though, perhaps the ref - who mind you was on the spot, saw something we
                didn't? Thankfully the resulting free kick did not find its target! Play then turned
                back to Nth Ryde's favour and Col had a great shot on goal that the keeper saved by
                the end of his fingertips. The midfield were playing brilliantly and putting some
                great balls through to feet. Matt S, Ando, Karim and Col had things well under
                control. Matt S then had a chance which had the crowd sighing when he missed. Ando
                then made another half attempt at scoring from a header but found the keeper waiting.
                There were lots more push and shove and things were getting hot, the ref kept the
                game under control. All of sudden up popped a sniper from the bushes at Magdala and
                Ado went down lick a big sack of potatoes. What happened, we were all asking, it was
                so funny! Carl then came on to make his return to the 2009 season. He looked spritely
                and ready.
                <br/><br/>
                Meanwhile the girls were enjoying the champagne, sunshine and football. Nth Ryde had
                a few more shots on goal but managed to keep WPH scoreless and win 1-0! I'm sure Agro
                has some bruises he hadn't accounted for before the game! Well done boys, let's keep
                it up!
