                All of the parents had a giggle together at the start of this game, watching the
                opposition being drilled in warm up to do their push ups. Far too serious and
                regimented for us!
                <br/><br/>
                The purple team showed better signs of concentration today and good centre line ups.
                Our goal today was a brilliant long range kick. Everyone did a really great job and
                played well as a team. Coach Marc tried some set plays today and the team found the
                new techniques useful to manoeuvre the ball.

                The clear blue skies and winter sunshine were a welcome sight at Morrison Bay this
                morning compared to the gloomy conditions and torrential rain that drenched our
                players when they faced their top-ranked Normanhurst rivals at the same grounds
                a few weeks ago. The spectacle was made complete with goal posts that actually had
                nets attached and the parents of both the North Ryde and Saints United sides that
                crowded the sidelines in preparation for their usual forty minutes of Saturday
                morning stress and entertainment.
                <br/><br/>
                <img class="noborder imgtopleft" src="images/photos/u9/20090725_u9_div1_2.jpg">
                And entertainment is what they got, certainly in the first ten to fifteen minutes of
                play as North Ryde put together their best display of fluid and quick-paced teamwork
                all season. The ball was moved from the back to the front of the field at lightning
                pace in a series of quick and simple passes that left Saints rooted to the ground
                and which made the whole game of football look incredibly simple.
                <br/><br/>
                <span class="bold">Tom Maclean</span> and <span class="bold">Jett</span> were
                particularly effective in defence, shutting down any form of attack with terrific
                speed and efficiency to quickly change the course of play back in North Ryde's favour.
                <span class="bold">Patrick</span> showed good skill in stopping the incoming ball in
                it's tracks, shifting it out of reach of his attackers and passing it unselfishly to
                <img class="noborder imgright" src="images/photos/u9/20090725_u9_div1_3.jpg">
                the next player in the chain. <span class="bold">Harrison</span> completed the
                defensive outfit with some good tackles and had no problems gaining 20 or 30 metres
                of real estate when his foot got some purchase on the ball.
                <span class="bold">Jack</span> wore the keeper gloves in the first half, but only had
                to deal with a couple of soft shots on goal - which he did with class and diligence -
                due to the impenetrable line of defence in front of him.
                <br/><br/>
                <img class="noborder imgtopleft" src="images/photos/u9/20090725_u9_div1_4.jpg">
                <span class="bold">David</span> was in excellent form in the right midfield and
                accounted for many of the goal-scoring opportunities in the first half, keeping his
                body upright and selecting the best moment to make his cross into the goalmouth.
                <span class="bold">Eli</span> chased the ball hard on the left wing, never giving the
                Saints a moment's rest as he ferreted the ball with unrelenting determination to claim
                the 50-50 wins. <span class="bold">Shannon</span> and <span class="bold">Adam</span>
                were the final links in the chain to score North Ryde's three goals within the first
                ten minutes of the game. Adam gave the Saints keeper no chance when he sank a great
                shot in the nets off his left boot, and Shannon using his favourite - and highly
                effective - touch, turn and go manoeuvre to bypass the defence and score.
                <br/><br/>
                But it was the passing game that was key in those first few minutes of the match that
                gave North Ryde the edge that Saints were unable to recover from. In their previous
                <img class="noborder imgright" src="images/photos/u9/20090725_u9_div1_5.jpg">
                encounter, North Ryde hung on to the ball a just a smidgen too long and gave the
                Saints defence the time they needed to move in for the tackle and effectively disrupt
                an otherwise good attacking move. But today the passes were being made after one or
                two touches, removing Saints from the picture altogether, and it couldn't have taken
                more than 6 - 8 seconds for the ball to move in a controlled fashion from the backs
                to the forwards. The sort of play that all parents on the sidelines dream of before
                every game.&nbsp;
                <img class="top noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_smiling.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                <img class="noborder imgtopleft" src="images/photos/u9/20090725_u9_div1_6.jpg">
                North Ryde did not find the same level of success in the second half as they did in
                the first, however, and seemed to fall back to some of their old habits of hogging
                the ball a bit too long again. Long enough to be tackled and end an otherwise useful
                attacking stroke. Saints United, to their credit, gave a stronger account of
                themselves in the second half, particularly in defence, and North Ryde were unable
                to add to their 3-goal tally of the first half.
                <br/><br/>
                They did try though, and the ratio of attempts on goal must have been in the region
                of five to one. Shannon had retired his striker duties for the keeper's gloves but
                was never really put to the test all throughout the second half. The North Ryde
                defence was as rock-solid as it had been in the first half, but some of the polish
                had come off the team's general passing game which saw many an attacking opportunity
                go begging, and the finishing off in front of the goal was a bit lacklustre.
                <br/><br/>
                The rather flat second half, however, can not take away from this young div 1 team
                the terrific game of football they played today. They had no substitutes all match,
                and their level of fitness can only be compared to the level of determination they
                had to win the ball and appease their competitive spirit. They continue to live up
                to their own expectations, and, of course, the stress-laden expectations of their
                parents on the sidelines&nbsp;

                This was a re-scheduled game from Week 1. It was a hard game with a couple of players
                still recovering from their winter ailments. Oscar had two attempts at goal, and there
                were a lot of good passes from Sam and Peter.

                Andrhea showed character as she took on some of the big Glenhaven boys. Matt and Peter
                managed great clearance kicks in defence.&nbsp;

                <br/><br/>
                Glenhaven led by 4 goals to nil at the break. They kicked powerful shots from various
                angles and Ryan had a tough job as goalkeeper between the North Ryde posts.
                <br/><br/>
                <img class="imgtopright noborder" src="images/photos/u9/20090725_u9_div4_4.jpg">
                The coach gave some helpful advice at halftime which usually helps the team to perform
                better. In the second half, Matthew worked hard to ward off further attacks on the
                North Ryde goals.
                <br/><br/>
                Young Hamish dribbled the ball with some fancy footwork. Rhea, Oscar and Sam worked in
                a triangular fashion and managed to make a few shots on goal, but by the final whistle
                Glenhaven had won the game by 7 goals to nil.
                <br/><br/>
                The Player of the Week award went to Sam and the overall award went to Matthew. The
                team needs more training especially since there hasn't been any for the past 2 weeks.

                With the holidays behind us, and with a fully squad ready to roar, it was back to
                the serious matter of kicking back on a Saturday morning to enjoy watching the blue
                & yellows run round.
                <br/><br/>

                For the first half of the opening term, we seemed to be right on top.
                <span class="bold">Benyad</span> was right at home in his 'newish' position of
                centre back. His right boot has really come along well this season and he is one
                of our better kickers!&nbsp;
                <img class="top noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_smiling.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                <span class="bold">Brooke</span> was happy to be goalie in the first half and she
                repaid the coach for putting confidence in her with some lovely saves.
                <br/><br/>
                Against the run of play, WPH popped in a couple of goals,
                <img class="imgright noborder" src="images/photos/u9/20090725_u9_div6_3.jpg">
                but we were not discouraged with <span class="bold">Luke</span> and
                <span class="bold">Massie</span> doing some lovely dribbling runs and
                <span class="bold">Luke</span> hitting the post with one attempt on goal.
                <br/><br/>
                <img class="imgtopleft noborder" src="images/photos/u9/20090725_u9_div6_4.jpg">
                The second half was end to end stuff. <span class="bold">Maggie</span> was getting
                right into the thick of things up front following the ball all the way to their goalie
                and 'player of the match' <span class="bold">Lucy</span> was outstanding showing off
                those new skills of passing and chasing!&nbsp;
                <img class="top noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_thumbs_up.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                <span class="bold">Thomas</span> and <span class="bold">Chris</span> were again
                tireless in attack and defence with <span class="bold">Saxon</span> quickly turning
                into a very reliable defender making his presence felt with some great tackles and
                tireless chasing.
                <br/><br/>
                The second half we found ourselves quickly down another goal, but our super mid
                <img class="imgright noborder" src="images/photos/u9/20090725_u9_div6_5.jpg">
                fielder come striker <span class="bold">Massie</span> slotted a terrific goal and
                we were in with a sniff.&nbsp;

                All the players responded splendidly to the coach's request of trying not to be so
                polite on the field - as we are often guilty of that dreadful sin and the bain of any
                coaches plans called 'ball watching'.
                <br/><br/>
                This week there were some real go-getters who were getting in there for those 50/50
                <img class="imgleft noborder" src="images/photos/u9/20090725_u9_div6_6.jpg">
                balls. <span class="bold">Julian</span>, <span class="bold">Timmy</span> and
                <span class="bold">Ben</span> were getting right in there and even won a few of these
                challenges.
                <br/><br/>
                Second half volunteer goalie <span class="bold">Josh</span> was very diligent in
                carrying out his duties and kept the crowd entertained!
                <br/><br/>
                In the end we simply ran out of time, but we were far from disgraced. All the players
                have improved markedly - especially in the getting there and getting 'angry' for the
                ball.
                <br/><br/>
                Special thanks to <span class="bold">Tony</span> for the constant juggling of the (4)
                subs on the side line. Each week, all players get a fair go and Tony makes this very
                tricky job look easy in shuffling the troops.
