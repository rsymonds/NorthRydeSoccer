                Yet again this week, it was such a close match. Well done to the NRS Purple team
                for the consistent improvement! This week everyone was super keen to get on the
                field and play, so they all had a great run. Most of the Purple's appear to prefer
                the defensive techniques of the game, trying to block balls and guard the goal.
                <br/><br/>
                <span class="bold">Lukah</span> and <span class="bold">Lucas</span> blocked a few
                NHF goals, with Lukah running near the length of the field to make a save.
                <span class="bold">Will</span> did some fantastic attacking of the ball today,
                blocking it in front of the NHF pack. <span class="bold">Jasmine</span> and
                <span class="bold">Cameron</span> also did some good ball blocks too. Good kicking
                came from <span class="bold">Jayden</span> all over the field.
                <br/><br/>
                Given we scored twice for the other team, we're on track for a win really soon!
                All the kids loved their muddy spotted socks at the end of the game.&nbsp;

                The long trek from those that parked on Buffalo Road would prove to be too much for
                some of our players to handle. This is certainly one ground where home ground advantage
                plays a big part and the fact that our opponents had all entered from the Victoria
                Road end, meant that their players would be a lot fresher. If you think I'm looking
                for excuses or simply clutching at straws, then you are correct!
                <br/><br/>
                On a more serious note, it was nice to actually string two consecutive games together
                as previous washouts were making it difficult for our coach Chris to develop our team's
                skills. On what looked to be dry and firm pitch, a high scoring match was seemingly
                in order and the crowd weren't disappointed... perhaps the Putney crowd that is!
                <br/><br/>
                From the outset, our opponents looked sharp in attack and our guys in particular
                <span class="bold">Dominic</span>, <span class="bold">Emma</span> and
                <span class="bold">Ben</span> were working overtime in defence. As the ground was in
                pretty good shape, this was a more expansive game than we were used to and it also
                meant that <span class="bold">Ben</span> was able to make a few inroads into Putney's
                half only to lack a bit of support at the final pass.
                <br/><br/>
                <span class="bold">Jake</span> and <span class="bold">Felix</span> were introduced
                into the game midway the first half and both were very keen to make an impression.
                <span class="bold">Jake</span> found himself in the thick of the action trying to get
                the ball going forward and <span class="bold">Felix</span> was doing the hard work in
                the heavy exchanges trying to win the ball for the likes of <span class="bold">Ben</span>
                and <span class="bold">Emma</span> to make incisive runs downfield. Whilst all this
                was going on, <span class="bold">Erin</span> was her usual efficient self, providing
                her team mates with some excellent passes from re-starts from the goal and sidelines.
                <br/><br/>
                Try as they might, we were being outplayed by a very good opposition and it would
                have been easy to just go through the motions after half time. The second half showed
                why our team has got the potential blend into a very good unit, as they more than
                held their own in the second half, perhaps even taking the honours.
                <span class="bold">Dominic</span> was a rock in defence, frustrating his opponents
                on a number of occasions. <span class="bold">Felix</span> again kept 'winning' the
                hard ball and <span class="bold">Emma</span> whilst dealing with some physical
                marking from her opponents, more than held her own and created plenty of scoring
                opportunities. <span class="bold">Erin</span> was doing the little things right and
                <span class="bold">Ben</span> was making raids downfield with monotonous regularity.
                <br/><br/>
                Our <span class="bold">Player of the Match</span> this week was
                <span class="bold red">Jake</span>, our little quiet achiever who is growing in
                confidence more and more every week. <span class="bold red">Jake</span> kept going
                the whole game and was never far away from the action.&nbsp;
                <img class="top noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_thumbs_up.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                With a bit of 'brushing up' on our calling and passing game, the signs look good
                for our team. The eagerness is there, the enjoyment is there and the skills are
                definitely improving.

                It was a game of what ifs for the under 8 division white team this week. Playing away
                to Ryde Saints United we came across a very evenly matched team in what turned out
                to be a very entertaining match. With a little more luck the result could have very
                easily gone the other way.
                <br/><br/>
                Highlights of the first half included Zane's effort in goal with a massive 10 goal
                saves as well as great shots on goal by Salim, Christian and Hayley. There was plenty
                of ball movement up and down the field with Connor, James and Jack getting the ball
                out into free space superbly. We were unlucky to be down 1 nil at the break after a
                lucky goal from Saints. The crowd highlight was a slip and fall into the mud from
                the ref (me). Mental note - bring better shoes next week.&nbsp;
                <img class="top noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_embarassed.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                The second half produced a mixed bag of excellent attacking play from North Ryde as
                well as some long range goals from the opposition. Lioda was in the thick of the
                action as usual showing some great skills but the player of the day went to
                Christian who had an outstanding 6 attempts at goal and was very unlucky not pick
                up a couple of goals.&nbsp;
                <img class="top noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_thumbs_up.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                Let's hope the weather holds out and we can have a much needed training session
                this week.

                After another wet and gloomy week, and what seemed like weeks of rained-off
                training and games, Saturday finally dawned with a sunny and bright blue sky!
                We arrived at Holy Cross glad to see the sunshine and to be playing at a local
                ground!
                <br/><br/>
                <img class="noborder imgtopleft" src="images/photos/u9/20090606_u9_div1_2.jpg">
                As soon as the ref's whistle blew a fierce contest began and both teams slogged out
                a hard, tight and low-scoring match despite the long grass and wet track.
                <br/><br/>
                North Ryde launched repeated attacks. Patrick was rock solid.
                <br/><br/>
                David, Adam and Shannon fought hard and had a few great shots. Tom Hurst was everywhere
                in defence and delivered some top passes.
                <br/><br/>
                One of Tom H's passes was a well-timed delivery through to Shannon, who moved towards
                the goals at pace and slotted a cracking shot past the keeper to give North Ryde the
                lead.&nbsp;

                Well done to Mark who did a great job running the line, and retrieving the match ball
                when it accelerated down the hill.
                <br/><br/>
                Tom Maclean, Charlie, Jack, Eli, Anthony and Harrison all played strong and helped win
                the battle.
                <br/><br/>
                In the second half North Ryde launched a barrage of attacks on the Saints goalie, and
                with a bit more luck it could have been 5-nil.
                <br/><br/>
                There were 4 corners that were close to adding to the scoreboard, and quite a few
                long-range shots that were just off target. Jett's terrific shot shaved the post
                leaving us all thinking it was a goal.
                <br/><br/>
                Pauline was cool, calm and calculated in the way she orchestrated our game plan and
                the run of play.
                <br/><br/>
                Well done team, coach, players, linesman, supporters and match officials - another
                entertaining contest was enjoyed by all!

                Well, after our training was washed out during the week, the weather finally came
                good for us and we enjoyed a beautiful warm & sunny day at West Epping Oval. Our
                opposition being the formidable Glenhaven team challenged our goal early but some
                quick thinking by Thomas O saw the ball taken straight back into the other half.
                It wasn't long before the pressure was back onto us though with Glenhaven scoring
                in the first 4 minutes of the game.
                <br/><br/>
                Glenhaven went on to challenge time & again which tested our defence to it's limits.
                <br/><br/>
                Andrhea was at her usual defensive best preventing many attempts at goal by Glenhaven,
                keeping the attacking opposition busy whilst our other team members could get into a
                better defensive position.
                <br/><br/>
                Some good play by Liam saw the ball back into Glenhaven's half and a bit of our own
                attack ensued before finding ourselves defending a relentless attack on our goal. A
                brilliant save by Matt only delayed the inevitable second goal by the opposition 8
                minutes into the first half.
                <br/><br/>
                Rhea arrived late and her inclusion was immediately felt with our attack ability
                rising noticeably the instant she took the field.
                <br/><br/>
                More attack by Glenhaven followed but some great play by Peter and Liam saw us on
                the attack again with Peter in shooting position but found himself shut down by
                powerful defence and was unable to score.
                <br/><br/>
                There were some more good saves by Matt, a number of great saves by first half Goalie
                Hamish who found himself fearlessly diving onto the ball amidst a relentless opposition,
                and an incredible save by Sam when Hamish found himself caught too far out. There was
                some good work by Satya to keep the pressure on the opposition and great tackling by
                Sam enabled Matt to have a shot at goal, however it just went wide.
                <br/><br/>
                A corner kick enabled Glenhaven to score a fourth and final goal for the first half.
                <br/><br/>
                The second half proved a little better with more attack coming from our side. Ryan was
                our goalie for the second half and his tireless defence and big boot certainly helped
                to keep the score to a minimum.
                <br/><br/>
                Glenhaven eventually scored another 2 goals making the final score 6-0 to them.

                Great to actually get out and have a kick around after all that rain. Seems like an
                eternity since we trained and that funny yellow ball in the sky made a much welcomed
                return, just in the knick of time.
                <br/><br/>
                The long weekend and illness knocked our team around this week but we still managed to
                make up the minimum nine required to fill a full team.
                <br/><br/>
                Well, what a great effort from everyone this week. You ran yourselves into the ground!
                We were so unlucky to lose. The West Pennant Hills goalkeeper made so many great saves
                and the scoreline was no indication of how the game actually played out.
                <br/><br/>
                <span class="bold">Tom</span> and <span class="bold">Julian</span> shared the
                goalkeeping duties and really went well. Both made some excellent saves and kicks to
                free space. Their goal-kicks were excellent also. <span class="bold">Josh</span> and
                <span class="bold">Tim</span> were so good in defence, making tackles that saved us
                on many occasions. <span class="bold">Massie</span> and
                <span class="bold">Christopher</span> seemed to have build up a good partnership with
                their teamwork resulting in an excellent goal to Massie.
                <br/><br/>
                <span class="bold">Luke</span> and <span class="bold">Lucy</span> both tried really
                hard all day and Lucy, that was your best game yet! <span class="bold">Benyad</span>
                was as usual Mr Consistent helping out well up front and at the back.
                <br/><br/>
                Days like Saturday make you want the next game to come around as quickly as possible.
                Thanks to all the parents, family and friends who turned up to support this great
                effort, your support is really appreciated.
                <br/><br/>
                See you all at training Wednesday.
