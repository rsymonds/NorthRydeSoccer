                <span class="bold">Jayden</span> was a like a knight in armour today, doing a chest
                block of the ball whilst <span class="bold">Lukah</span> was kicking in.
                <span class="bold">Will</span> did a great job kicking the balls in today, as did
                <span class="bold">Jasmine</span>, both improving their range.
                <span class="bold">Lukah</span> made an exciting goal save, sliding across the field
                in front of the goal, whilst later scoring a goal!

                <span class="bold">Will</span> got energetic around the goal today and got tangled

                <span class="bold">Cameron</span> partnered well to block a goal together - great
                teamwork boys!&nbsp;

                <span class="bold">Cameron</span> tried really hard today to attack the ball more
                and turn it around, and later did a great headblock whilst laying on the field.
                First header of the season!
                <br/><br/>
                The team missed <span class="bold">Lucas</span> whilst he was sick today.

                A goal fest which had been coming all season and will be good for the confidence
                coming in to the pointy end of the season.
                <br/><br/>
                We were two up within 7 minutes with the sharp shooting of Shannon who showed great
                composure all game. Adam then scored one off a pass from Shannon to make it three
                nil. The fourth was an own goal from a corner and I was beginning to feel sorry for
                West Ryde Rovers.
                <br/><br/>
                We were playing well across the park and moving the ball out wide from Jett and

                Thomas at the back. Jack had a turn at centre back and looked quite a home.
                <br/><br/>
                The second half started much the same and Shannon grabbed another brace to make it
                a hatrick and a long range shot from David who never stopped running all day dipped
                just under the bar. Charlie then scored a couple more to round off a great day.
                <br/><br/>
                We play West Ryde Rovers again in a few weeks time and will be looking for more of
                the same.

                Well, the day started a chilly 11.5 Deg C and it didn't get much better. Right from
                the kickoff, West Pennant Hills (WPH) was on the attack and it wasn't long after a
                corner kick that they were shooting at our goal, but some great defence by Peter
                saw the attempt quashed. Another corner kick ensured and this time it was Anaya
                that was able to prevent a goal against us.
                <br/><br/>
                We were able to then take the ball to the other end of the field where we started
                our attack but we were quickly shut down by a determined opposition.
                <br/><br/>
                Some great defence by Andrhea and Matt stopped another quick goal attempt by WPH.
                Another corner kick saw a missed goal attempt by WPH. Eventually by the end of the
                first half the score was 4-0 to WPH.
                <br/><br/>
                The second proved to be better. After some words by coach Alan Ball during half
                time, the team seemed to come with Oscar and Rhea managing to set up and score our
                only goal.&nbsp;

                <br/><br/>
                WPH were only able to score another two times with the score finally standing at
                6-1 by the end of the game.

                North Ryde Nachos did a great job with defending in the First half - they were by
                far the stronger side. The Nachos were hungry for a goal but alas the couple of
                shots we had proved futile.
                <br/><br/>
                The second half unfortunately ended up with Beecroft scoring! The score didn't
                really reflect how well the side played - should have been a draw was the
                spectators opinion. Next time...

                A solid performance by the team this week against a team who certainly didn't have
                anything over us in the way of ability (but maybe in age).
                <br/><br/>
                The boys got off to a flying start with Stephen B-H scoring the opening goal, but
                West Ryde scored 2 unanswered goals for our boys to go 2-1 down. However the team
                were having none of that and showing courage and commitment fought their way back
                with goals to Sam B and Jordan C to take a 3-2 lead heading toward full time.
                <br/><br/>
                Alas a defensive lapse with time running out saw West Ryde score an equaliser to
                earn an undeserved 3-3 draw as our boys had the better of the match for most of the
                time. Don't worry boys we will get them next time.&nbsp;
