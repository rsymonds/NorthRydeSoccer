                After a rain-out the previous week, the team was ready to give it another go. The
                start time 8:15 was again a challenge, but we all made it just in time. Unfortunately
                <span class="bold">Cameron</span> could not make it due to the flu. We hope he will
                recover soon so that he can be there for next week.
                <br/><br/>
                The manager brought the new shirts, and didn't they look good. Our proud North Ryde
                youngsters looked the part. The new challenge this week was the wet pitch with some
                muddy puddles. 'Don't worry about it that is part of soccer', were the words of the
                Coach.
                <br/><br/>
                The team shook hands before the game, which set the scene for a friendly match. The
                kids started the game really well. The dragons were an even match and the game was
                flowing up and down the field. With that the kids had to do quite a bit of running.
                <span class="bold">Jasmine</span> did some excellent kicks and kept on defending.
                <span class="bold">Jayden</span> made a short appearance, and made sure at half-time
                the 'Player of the week' trophy was returned.
                <br/><br/>
                With some excellent running, follow up, good passing and dribbling the team scored
                quite a number of goals. High fives were flying around everywhere. The goals fell on
                both sides and at half-time North Ryde and Macquarie felt they had achieved a lot.
                <br/><br/>
                The second half continued in the same pace. <span class="bold">Luka</span> was all
                over the field, defending, passing and scoring. It was a great all round performance.
                <span class="bold">Lucas</span> had a good block in midfield and came up with the ball
                and running it a goal. He just missed. <span class="bold">Will</span> kept his eye on
                the ball and never gave up. At the end the draw was so close, with the final shot of
                <span class="bold">Luka</span> hitting the post.
                <br/><br/>
                The whole team made a great effort&nbsp;

                After another frustrating period of no training or game the week prior to this
                inter-club 'clash', our guys were once again slightly under prepared but the thought
                of playing against some of their training partners was (or should have been) motivation
                enough. Our opponents did appear to have our measure in the size stakes but this seems
                to be the situation most games and doesn't appear to bother our little troopers.
                <br/><br/>
                There were ominous signs early when our opponents started to make early in roads into
                our defence but some slick defending from <span class="bold">Dominic</span> and
                <span class="bold">Emma</span> was keeping them at bay. The heavy conditions meant
                that passing was going to be a difficult task so our team kept the ball in nice and
                tight with <span class="bold">Jake</span> and <span class="bold">Ben</span> doing
                some solid work in a lot of traffic.
                <br/><br/>
                The introduction of our super subs <span class="bold">Erin</span> and
                <span class="bold">Felix</span> gave the team some fresh legs when they were needed
                and some go forward. <span class="bold">Felix</span> picked up where he left of last
                game by really getting involved and <span class="bold">Erin</span> once again followed
                coach Chris's instructions to the letter by kicking the ball into open space
                (unfortunately no one chases it... from our team that is).
                <br/><br/>
                <span class="bold">Dominic</span> was displaying some terrific skills under pressure,
                using the kick-back move to good effect to stop some of our opponents raids whilst
                <span class="bold">Ben</span> was playing a blinder getting the team going forward
                and unlucky not to put a few in the net himself.
                <br/><br/>
                Our <span class="bold">Player of the Match</span> this week was
                <span class="bold red">Emma</span> who richly deserved the award for some great play
                in both attack and particularly her defensive effort. Often when we were creating a
                chance at goal or a last ditch tackle was needed, <span class="bold red">Emma</span>
                was involved in the action.&nbsp;
                <img class="top noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_thumbs_up.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                Unfortunately, the stop-start nature of the season so far has made it difficult for
                our team to really build any sort of cohesion but again, there are very encouraging
                signs in most facets of the game that just need to come together and Chris is slowly
                building a very talented unit. Thanks to Jes for yet again providing the half time
                refreshments and to Chris for encouraging the players at all times.
                <br/><br/>
                Well done also to Ken and the 'C' team for a wonderful game. They are a very talented
                group and hopefully can inspire our team to reach the same level.

                Despite an early start and a cold morning which was preceded by an evening of pouring
                rain the Boys turned up and eager to play. The first half was a close encounter,
                sprinkled with great play showcasing the young lads emerging skills, and team play.
                <br/><br/>
                Buried in the North Ryde half Jason was instrumental in stopping the Saints United
                crew from scoring. The boys tried hard to follow the game plan of playing up the
                sideline but caught back in defence and struggling, Saints United scored a sizzler
                of a goal. Then shortly after through a maze of tireless North Ryde defence, they
                scored again.
                <br/><br/>
                The second half, saw Angus power through a shot at goal, only to have it just roll
                wide. Yet, shortly after, the fighting North Ryde spirit prevailed with Ben tackling
                the ball from the opposition followed by his sizzling shot which flew straight into
                the net for North Ryde’s first goal. The score stuck at 2-1, North Ryde scrambled
                defiantly and proudly in defence, with strong kicks from Raphael, one clearing kick
                near our goal dented the Saints United onslaught.  Disheartingly, Saints United
                struck with 2 quick goals. But, in defiance of the score, Hugh, Ben and Henry, helped
                by William, Jason and Ben kept pushing forward, constantly trying to break free to get
                another well deserved goal, as Angus - again, showing his great covering defence, came
                through and preventing  an Saints United attack.
                <br/><br/>
                With the game over North Ryde had displayed a fighting and spirited heart, made all
                the more rewarding by the sight of our young cubs showing their emerging talents,
                athletic skill, perseverance and the joy of playing with each other. Well done Boys,
                and good luck with the next one.

                Despite the churned-up cricket pitch and small lake that made up the centre of the
                football pitch at Boronia Park, the U9 Div 1's were spared a few hours of clear sky
                <img class="imgleft noborder" src="images/photos/u9/20090530_u9_div1_2.jpg">
                during an otherwise gloomy weekend to stretch their legs and ply their trade against
                a motivated Gladesville Ravens outfit this morning.
                <br/><br/>
                The game was played at pace from the word go, with both sides moving the ball up
                and down the field at speed as they sized each other up and tried to claim some
                dominance in the game. But after a few minutes it was evident that North Ryde had
                established an edge over their opponents and were able to control the run of play
                for most of the first half at will.
                <br/><br/>
                Young Anthony frustrated the forwards in the midfield, and no man or beast ventured
                too close to Harrison when he came charging in with his swinging right foot. The
                defence held rock-solid, which must have frustrated Charlie in his first-half spell
                as goal keeper, who even under normal circumstances feels uncomfortable without the
                ball hovering somewhere around his feet&nbsp;
                <img class="top noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_smiling.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                North Ryde's passing game during the first half was superb, and they moved the ball
                from the backs through the midfield to the forwards with spectacular speed. Jack was
                <img class="imgright noborder" src="images/photos/u9/20090530_u9_div1_3.jpg">
                a telling factor on the right wing and generally had the final say on who would win
                the ball and which direction he'd prefer it to go.
                <br/><br/>
                Not much gets past Tom Maclean either, whose effective tackling and precision passes
                always contribute to a surge toward the goals. He linked up well in the midfield with
                <img class="imgleft noborder" src="images/photos/u9/20090530_u9_div1_4.jpg">
                David, who seemed to be wherever the ball was, and who used his speed and agility to
                thread his way through the defence and feed the ball into the danger zone.
                <br/><br/>
                It didn't take long before North Ryde were rewarded for their efforts with several
                shots at goal. One of which came when Tom Hurst took advantage of a deflected ball
                with a terrific strike from about thirty metres out which would have added quite
                nicely to the scoreboard if it hadn't been for the safe hands of the in-form Ravens
                keeper whose saves were proving to be as good as his massive clearance kicks downfield.
                <br/><br/>
                But North Ryde persisted nonetheless, and a smooth succession of terrific passes from
                the right side of the field saw the ball move swiftly from David in the midfield to
                Eli in the front pack, and switch again to the last man in the line, Adam, who struck
                the ball cool as you like with power and a low trajectory into the bottom right
                <img class="imgright noborder" src="images/photos/u9/20090530_u9_div1_5.jpg">
                corner of the net. It was one of North Ryde's best and most well orchestrated goals
                of the season so far&nbsp;
                <img class="top noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_thumbs_up.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                North Ryde continued to play the remainder of the first half in a now familiar
                fashion. The backs were rock-solid in their defence and were as quick to smother any
                scoring opportunities by the Ravens as they were to launch a new counter-attack. The
                speedsters in the midfield raced the ball into the danger zone within seconds and
                <img class="imgleft noborder" src="images/photos/u9/20090530_u9_div1_6.jpg">
                the forwards relished their opportunity to seal the transaction.
                <br/><br/>
                One of the most encouraging aspects of the North Ryde game is their continued sense
                of ball control and maintaining possession. Balls are being stopped, trapped and
                moved again with authority, and any loose or wild kicks are fast becoming the
                exception to the rule. The first half belonged to North Ryde, who went on to enjoy
                several more shots at goal that were well taken by the Ravens keeper before the
                half-time whistle blew.
                <br/><br/>
                The second half had a slightly different colour to it. The slick passing game that
                had defined the North Ryde success in the first half seemed to desert them and there
                was a lot more jostling and scrambling for the ball to keep a rejuvenated Ravens team
                at bay.
                <br/><br/>
                Eli had taken up the goal-keeping duties in the second half and was put to the test
                several times as the Ravens came storming up to the goals, deperate to settle the
                score. On one occasion he made a terrific save that involved stopping a powerball
                <img class="imgleft noborder" src="images/photos/u9/20090530_u9_div1_7.jpg">
                destined for the back of the net in midflight, and a scramble to keep it off the
                goal line after the initial deflection. What a save!&nbsp;
                <img class="top noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_thumbs_up.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                <img class="imgtopright noborder" src="images/photos/u9/20090530_u9_div1_8.jpg">
                Suddenly North Ryde seemed to be on the back foot and you got the feeling that the
                next goal might decide the match. The sidelines became more vocal as the supporters
                in each camp urged their teams on, and Pauline had her work cut out exchanging players
                at the right time and offering timely advice to the game in progress.
                <br/><br/>
                But despite the apparent change of fortune, North Ryde kept their foot on the pedal.
                Fitness and stamina were still their best friends and their efforts to hold onto the
                match were relentless.
                <br/><br/>
                Jett set up camp in his own half and played a pivotal role in not only warding off
                the Ravens attackers, but turning his tackles into the start of an effective counter
                attack as well. Patrick moved the ball well through the midfield and delivered some
                excellent passes to his forwards.
                <br/><br/>
                <img class="imgtopright noborder" src="images/photos/u9/20090530_u9_div1_9.jpg">
                Shannon was onto the ball in his usual terrier-fashion and moved the ball down his
                favourite left-wing side with terrific speed. Charlie, having served his time in goals
                and on the bench, made the most of his time on the field with some great dribbling
                and moving the ball into the danger zone. Things were starting to warm up again for
                North Ryde.
                <br/><br/>
                The second goal came midway through the second half in a similar fashion to their
                first. Moving the ball effectively from player to player again bore dividends as
                Adam, for the second time in the game, was the final link in the passing chain to
                finish off the movement with a well-timed and stylish kick into the bottom right
                corner of the goals. Great goal!&nbsp;
                <img class="top noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_thumbs_up.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                To their credit, the Ravens did not take the 2-0 scoreline lying down and lifted
                their game to launch a series of attacks against the North Ryde goal, ultimately
                finding success deep in the second half when a forward took advantage of a loose
                ball and worked it into the back of the North Ryde nets. Well done to them.
                <br/><br/>
                Despite losing some impetus after the Ravens goal, North Ryde stuck to their guns
                and levelled the run of play to a point where they were still having a go at the
                opposition goal within the closing minutes. There were a lot of sweaty faces that
                left the field at the end of the game despite the cool weather, and their 2-1
                success against a worthy opponent is a tribute to their determination and
                competitive natures.
                <br/><br/>
                Well done North Ryde!&nbsp;

                An early start and a lovely cool morning greeted us all on Saturday. The kids were keen
                to play after a wash-out the week before.
                <br/><br/>
                <img class="noborder imgtopleft" src="images/photos/u9/20090530_u9_div4_2.jpg">
                Straight from the start the Ravens had us on the back foot. Kicking their first goal
                within the first few minutes and a second not much long after.
                <br/><br/>
                The team was a bit shell-shocked but pressed on... defending their own goals for most
                of the first half. The score at half-time was 5 - 0 Ravens way.
                <br/><br/>
                After the half-time pep talk the kids played a stronger more motivated second half,
                with most of the half being played around the centre circle.
                <br/><br/>
                There were many unsuccessful attemps at goal from both teams which reflected in the
                second-half score, which was only 1 - 0 to the Ravens.
                <br/><br/>
                Overall score was Ravens 6, North Ryde 0. Well played team, better luck next game&nbsp;

                Whether it was the fact that it was a little cooler this morning or that some scout
                leaked a secret to our team that the opposition (OLHC Epping) was undefeated - I am
                not sure - whatever it was, the mighty NRSC Under 9 Div 6s were a little slow out of
                the blocks and 40 seconds after 'special guest' referee
                <span class="bold">Tony's</span> opening whistle, we found ourselves 1-0 down!
                <br/><br/>
                Then, they popped in another soft goal and those on the sideline we were wondering
                if it would be a cricket score! It was not to be!  From then on our guys 'n gals
                really shone. It was tense end-to-end stuff and some of the tackles were not for
                the faint hearted.
                <br/><br/>
                Special mention goes to <span class="bold">Maggie</span> who bravely took up the
                No. 1 jersey in the first half and after a few tries slotted a wonderful team goal
                in the second half&nbsp;
                <img class="bottom noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_thumbs_up.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                We can take some real positives out of this game as we actually won the second half
                1 - 0, thanks to some very strong defending from <span class="bold">Thomas</span>,
                <span class="bold">Julian</span> and <span class="bold">Chris</span>.
                <span class="bold">Benyad</span> kept a clean sheet with some wonderful saves and
                man of the match <span class="bold">Luke</span> was very impressive with a few solid
                shots on goal - only to be thwarted time and again by their very strong goalie.
                <br/><br/>
                Well done to everyone - we didn't win - except if you don't count the first half -
                and everyone had fun which is the main thing.

                Once again the team got off to a bad start conceding a goal before the spectators
                had a chance to focus on the field. A second goal followed soon after before the
                team once again seemed to find some cohesion and made the opposition fight hard
                for the remainder of the first half going to the break 4 goals down.
                <br/><br/>
                The early part of the second half belonged to our boys and they managed to pull
                back a good goal scored by Lewis B after some good lead up work by the mid field
                and a nice pass from William G who was having a break from goalkeeping. William
                was ably replaced by Tyrone P from the Under 14 side who was given several
                opportunities to show his goalkeeping skills in a higher grade and he certainly
                acquitted himself well as did the other 2 Under 14 players who helped out on the
                day Robert J and Mitchell K. Thanks boys for your efforts and thank you to your
                parents for bringing you along.
                <br/><br/>
                Despite the scoreline the boys never gave up and competed to the final whistle.

                It was a dodgy day to say the least, the rain had been intermittent for days and there
                were some definite grey clouds around today. The game was also being played at Santa
                Rosa Park, which when we arrived, looked soggy and muddy down one side of the park.
                Would the boys be able to handle the wet conditions? A win today could see them move
                into the top two, depending on goal difference. With 4 players out would the boys be
                able to run all day without as many super subs as they usually had?
                <br/><br/>
                The ref blew time on and immediately Nth Ryde applied the pressure, Brownie put a
                great ball through to Pommie Pete but in the wet Pommie found it hard to get going
                and the ball had a little too much on it for him to bring it under control and make
                any sort of shot on goal. Nth were able to win a few corners out of the first ten
                minutes of the game and looked likely to score. Macca had been secretly practicing
                his headers all week after watching the champions league final (thinking he could
                emulate Messi's great header) so his first touch on the ball was an attempted header
                on goal. Unfortunately he didn't get enough on it and the keeper cleaned up the spoils.
                Higgo thought he could go one better and the ball hit the cross bar. Macca then had
                another, much better header attempt but the keeper got his fingers to it and saved it.
                The disappointment on his face! The good thing was with all these attempts on goal,
                NHFC hadn't even been in Nth Ryde's half. Col then had his chance with another great
                hit on goal but only managed to find the waiting arms of the keeper. If Nth were going
                to keep up this sort of pressure, the results would come.
                <br/><br/>
                Finally (well not really wanting them to), NHFC has some time in the Nth Ryde half.
                Smithy was as ever brilliant in defence & was backed up very well in the midfield by
                Col who was finding space down the right wing. Browny was also backing up well and his
                clearances had some pinpoint accuracy to them. Finally Higgo got onto the end of a pass
                and put the most fantastic ball through to the flying Dutchman who scored, 1-0 Nth Ryde.
                The rain started coming down in buckets and the report was interrupted momentarily. The
                rain also made the ball a lot heavier and with every pass came a ball that landed dead
                in the mud. It seemed to be difficult to play, not knowing of the ball was going to
                skid on or stop dead. NHFC's tactics seemed to change and a player or two seemed to
                have a 'sniper in the bushes problem'! Higgo got hit in the head but recovered well.
                Col then put a lovely ball through to Higgo who had a shot on goal which was again
                saved by the keeper. NHFC cleared to a waiting Smithy who then passed a great ball
                onto Pommies' feet but Pommie just kicked it a little too far ahead of himself. He
                chased the ball down and managed to work a corner out of NHFC. The corner was taken
                and Dutchie blocked the ball with his body, passed it onto Pierre who kicked the ball
                into the bottom left hand corner of the net. Well done Nth, half time with a 2-0 lead.
                Considering the conditions, this was a good lead to have at half time.
                <br/><br/>
                The players took the field to begin the second half, Pierre applied early pressure but
                NHFC had seemed to regroup and had some early shots on goal which Agro saved with ease.
                The ball moved up and down the park and was getting wetter and heavier with each shower
                that passed overhead. The game was frustrating the crown as Nth were missing some easy
                opportunities to score. The game turned into a sliding competition and I was very glad
                I was not taking the shirts home to wash this week! Some notable plays by Col, Ando and
                Pommie were keeping Nth Ryde on the attack. Nth should have been more than 2-0 up at
                this stage and I was hoping the chances they had missed would not mean defeat or goals
                scored against them. Nth kept applying the pressure and late in the game the ball
                rebounded back to Ando who was waiting about 40 feet out from goal, he decided take
                his chance as Ronaldo and hit the ball hard, the ball hit the right hand goal post and
                rebounded into the goal! I still think Firgal's goal three weeks ago was the goal of
                the season so far, but Ando's goal was now definitely in the running (or so he would
                repeatedly tell us after the game!). He was remarkably happy with himself as was his
                team!
                <br/><br/>
                That ended a soggy, wet, but good day out for Nth Ryde with a 3-0 win that will see
                them move up the ladder. Sorry I won't be at the 9am Sunday game at Holland Park this
                week boys, the Wildcatz are playing at Nth Ryde oval at 9am and I'll go for the sleep in!
                <br/><br/>
                Good luck and play hard&nbsp;
