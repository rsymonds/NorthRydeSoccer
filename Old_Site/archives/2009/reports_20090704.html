                There were two major improvements in the guys this week, and both played a part in
                the convincing result.
                <br/><br/>
                The first was in following through of line ball's, or clearing kick's. Instead of
                just waiting for the opposition to bring the ball back, the team has started following
                through on these, and taking up on opportunities in the oppositions half.
                <br/><br/>
                Our second improvement was around shooting for goal when the opportunity comes to
                hand. Throughout the season the guys have tended to try and get the ball close to
                goal before taking a shot, and this has sometimes lead to us giving up possession.
                This week we saw them shooting from further out, or as soon as they see a clear goal.
                It opened up the game a lot more, and drove the guys to look for free space to open
                up more options.
                <br/><br/>
                This weeks 'Best Ball Skills' certificate went to Alex G, the 'Best Team Player'
                certificate was taken by Aden. Our best all rounder trophy went to Alex W.&nbsp;

                We were a bit short on players again, but the Panthers agreed to play 4x4 until
                another NRS player turned up. Thanks again to Daniel for filling the gap by quarter
                time!
                <br/><br/>
                It was a game where each of our boys did their bit, and everyone scored a goal! With
                many goals being kicked from half-way down the field, I think the boys are outgrowing
                their small field, and will enjoy a bigger space next year.
                <br/><br/>
                I saw some very deliberate passing between Daniel and Angus, excellent defence from
                Ben and Raph, and a well fought game from the Panthers. Jason was our player of the
                week, for an oustanding improvement over his first season.&nbsp;

                Well with such a wonderful morning weather we knew we were in for another great
                morning of soccer and we weren't disappointed right up to the very last minute of
                the game.
                <br/><br/>
                The boys were pumped and ready after their great win the week before, and as soon as
                the whistle blew they were into it, their little legs were going 100 miles an hour.
                Their training is definitely starting to show in their game with some great footwork
                and passing on display, as well as their position on the field more spread out rather
                than all just running for the ball at once.
                <br/><br/>
                Both teams were showing great defence and we were lucky to have Jay defend our goal
                on several occasions in the first half. He even showed us some of his dance moves
                with a high kick that stopped one of the attempts from going in.
                <br/><br/>
                Blake showed no fear in going up to the ball at any given time to retrieve it from
                his opponent and always had his trusty team mates Jarrod and Luke with him in support.
                <br/><br/>
                By the second half the pressure was on after Saints scored a goal, and within minutes
                they had managed to score another. Our boys didn't give in though and with some great
                runs by Kaiden and some fancy foot work by Luke M we were able to pass the ball on to
                our little goal scorer Jarrod and bring the score up to 2-/1.
                <br/><br/>
                With not much time left on the clock and the crowds going wild on the side the boys
                held it together. Even our little man Alex got some kicks in before, amazingly, the
                boys got the ball right on the whistle and drove home another goal to end the game
                in a draw.&nbsp;
                <img class="top noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_thumbs_up.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                It was a really exciting game and each week the boys are bringing more and more to
                the game, today showing that they don't give up when their chips are down.
                <br/><br/>
                Congratulations to Jay for winning player of the match today which makes his 7th
                birthday weekend even more special.&nbsp;

                North Ryde U8 White produced our best game of the season on Saturday with a courageous
                display put on by the whole team. With the flu ravaging the team during the week we
                could only pull together a squad of 6 on the day. We knew it was going to be a tough
                day playing a man down up against a Roselea team with 2 subs but we dug deep to pull
                off a draw.
                <br/><br/>
                Highlights of the first half included <span class="bold">Austin</span> and
                <span class="bold">Connor's</span> great work on defence along with
                <span class="bold">Salim's</span> excellent attacking play at the other end.
                <span class="bold">Will</span> played his best game of the season and was in the
                thick of everything. The second half produced the most entertaining football of the
                year. <span class="bold">Lioda</span> showed superb skills in the midfield and looked
                dangerous every time she touched the ball. With some good passing we managed to get
                the ball into our attacking zone where <span class="bold">Zane</span> was able to put
                one past the goal keeper to put us 1 nil in the lead. Unfortunately playing the whole
                game 1 man short eventually started to show and the North Ryde team and we started to
                tire out which led to a late goal to draw the match for Roselea.
                <br/><br/>
                Player of the day this week went to Lioda who ran hard all day, was always in support
                on attack and worked hard to get back on defence. Great game Lioda.&nbsp;

                The U9 Div 1's were up against it this morning in their encounter with a motivated
                Kenthurst team, whose apparent hunger for the win may have something to do with
                maintaining a top-four position on the ladder. It didn't help that Charlie and
                David were both still recovering from a bout of flu, our star defender Tom Hurst
                away on holiday in the UK, and a ref whose timidity seemed to count against us
                time and time again during the match.
                <br/><br/>
                <img class="imgtopleft noborder" src="images/photos/u9/20090704_u9_div1_2.jpg">
                But the Div 1's were up for it, and they flew about the field with all the energy
                they could muster, hunting for ball possession and seeking those infrequent
                opportunities to bury it into the Kenthurst nets. I say nets, but can't really
                remember if there were any? Most of the games so far have not had any nets attached
                to the goalposts, which has led to several indecisive calls from the ref as to
                whether a goal had been scored or not. But I digress. Some excellent teamwork up
                front and a classic pass from Eli was well received by Shannon who went on to
                score a great goal and give North Ryde the lead. Well done guys!&nbsp;

                It is always difficult to remember all the passages of play during the match, who
                did what and when, but I wanted to pick Jack out this time as a player I consider
                to be one of the quiet achievers and workhorses of the team. A cool customer, Jack
                is often seen somewhere in a defensive or midfield position, ripping the ball off
                the opposition in a calculated way and engineering the start of a new movement in
                his team's direction. Well done Jack, we see you&nbsp;
                <img class="top noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_winking.gif">

                Kenthurst came out fighting even harder in the second half, desperate to find the
                back of the North Ryde nets. There were several incredible fouls made against the
                North Ryde players which, it must be said, beggared belief. Eli was first up, launched
                into mid-air by a deliberate heave from his opposite number when he didn't even have
                the ball. Shannon was the target of the second attack and went down in similar fashion,
                fouled, if I remember correctly, by the same player who took Eli out. Adam came in at
                <img class="imgleft noborder" src="images/photos/u9/20090704_u9_div1_4.jpg">
                number three, his foul not as spectacular as the first two but he did seem to cop a
                few more later on as the game progressed. Still, the whistle remained silent. And so
                did the North Ryde players, to their credit, showing restraint and patience when it
                counted the most.&nbsp;
                <img class="top noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_thumbs_up.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                Kenthurst eventually got the goal they were looking for. A shot at goal from a rather
                acute angle which was all but saved by the keeper, unfortunately just spilling over
                the line after his valiant effort to stop it. This has been the story of the season
                so far for North Ryde really, where most of the goals conceded have been more the
                result of ill luck than they have been well constructed by the scoring side.
                <br/><br/>
                One goal each and midway in the second half. It was anyone's game now. Kenthurst went
                at it hammer and tongs and made quite a few breaks at the North Ryde goals. But they
                had Jett and Tom Maclean to contend with, who were both playing with courage and
                determination in defence, using their strength and speed to shut down anything that
                got too close to for their comfort. And if they did get through they'd always have
                Harrison's big swinging right foot to deal with.&nbsp;
                <img class="top noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_smiling.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                David looked for breaks down the right mid and Shannon down the left, Adam used his
                dribbling wizardry down the centre with Jack and Patrick in support, while Eli and
                Charlie hunted for their opportunities up front. They came close to scoring on a
                couple of occasions even though the attempts were more opportunistic than they were
                a smooth chain of connected passes and build-up towards the Kenthurst goals. The
                final whistle eventually blew and they had to be content with the draw.
                <br/><br/>
                The Div 1's showed tremendous spirit today, and retained their composure when it
                seemed the odds were a bit against them. I am always impressed with the high level
                of effort and energy that they apply to their game, and I know we are yet to see the
                best come out of this young group of skilful and talented players.
                <br/><br/>

                Equipped with fantastic weather and the sight of relief from the parents, we all
                gathered at Morrison Bay Park not far from our official ground with great
                anticipation. Everybody was pumped up and eager to get into the game.

                All the players were showing great footwork and passing during the match. Oscar
                displayed some fancy footwork and almost scored a goal 5 minutes into the game.
                Both teams were showing great defence and Thomas Sharp defended our goal on numerous
                occasions with his powerful and strong kicks and almost scored.
                <br/><br/>
                Peter showed great ball skills in the midfield and made us laugh with his fancy
                crab-crawling footwork trying to keep the ball from West Ryde Rovers in the second
                half. Samuel and Ryan did us proud by not let ball pass our goal line.
                <br/><br/>
                The pressure was on in the second half for both sides to score, but the boys and
                girls held it together. The game ended in a draw but a good time was had by all.
                It was a great game and the boys and girls showed us great skills but more training
                on spreading around the ground and passing rather than running for the ball all at
                once will enhance the skills greatly.

                always being prepared, and always following the ball until it's in the goal or dead.
                <br/><br/>
                <span class="bold">Lucas</span> provided strong cover in the middle of the park,
                putting together some nice 1-2's, <span class="bold">Joshua</span> ran the whole
                game on the wing and was very strong defensively as well.
                <span class="bold">Amon</span> on the other wing was (and as usual!) 2 steps ahead
                of the opposition, always with his eye on the whole game and just as deadly in
                defence as Josh.
                <br/><br/>
                Our back line defensively was like the great wall of China with only one or two
                balls getting past them the whole game. <span class="bold">Matia</span> is getting
                quicker every week and his big left footed clearing kicks are a real bonus to our
                arsenal of defences. Matia also put his hand up for a run in goals and kept a clean
                card for the second half (well done Matia!). <span class="bold">Morgan</span> on
                the right was his tireless self, running down every ball that entered his domain
                and setting up some beautiful line balls to the wingers.
                <span class="bold">Jay</span> was moved into the centre backs for the game and was
                definitely channelling a bit of 'the Cobra' (aka Cameron) as his defences were at
                full strength. Jay did a fantastic job of clearing the ball long and deep every
                time it came within range. <span class="bold">Christian</span> dominated in the
                goals in the first half being our rock of Gibraltar, and in the second half ran and
                tackled like his life depended upon it (or his coach had promised him a treat).
                <br/><br/>
                Well done to all the boys, your focus and team spirit definitely shined through on
                Saturday morning - I could not be prouder of your efforts.&nbsp;

                What was that? A game of 2 halves played by 2 different North Ryde sides alias
                Jeckyl and Hyde. The team that played the first half carried on from where they
                left off the week before against Glenhaven defending strongly and challenging for
                every ball. The marking was excellent and all in all the nil-all scoreline at
                halftime probably flattered the opposition.
                <br/><br/>
                I don't know what was in the oranges at half time but whwtever it was caused a
                metamorphosis in the team as they reverted back to all the evil old bad habits,
                waiting for the ball to bounce leaving players unmarked and generally letting the
                opposition play as they liked.
                <br/><br/>
                End result West pennant Hills scored 5 unanswered goals. A disappointing effort.
                The result in no way reflects on the Under 14 players who helped out for us on the
                days they all played strongly and never gave up. Thanks boys.
                <br/><br/>
                Hopefully the team can regroup for their next encounter. Heads up!&nbsp;
