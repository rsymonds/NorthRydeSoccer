                Jasmine this week did a fantastic big kick, right into the head of an opposing team
                member. Great tricky kick! Lukah did some really fast running to make saves in front
                of the goal.
                <br/><br/>
                At half time, Coach Marc said "Everyone was doing a good job with their blocking and
                passes."
                <br/><br/>
                It was a difficult team to play as they were really fast runners. They may have been
                hard to catch, but <span class="bold">Jayden</span>, <span class="bold">Jasmine</span>,

                Lukah: "I fooled the other team and then they scored our goal."

                A very close contest this week, with Putney only just getting there nose in front with
                a goal in the last 60 seconds. Arlen and Aden played their usual strong game up front,
                with Alex W and Alex G again driving ball's forward from the mid field. Alex C played
                a lot more defence this week as Troy, our stable defender, decided to take on a
                sweeping role and pushed a lot further forward.
                <br/><br/>
                Week after week the team's ball skills are developing, and we're seeing a lot more
                passing and movement into free space. Another highlight of the guys development has
                been the amount of talking they're doing, be it encouragement of their team mates,
                or calling for the ball.&nbsp;

                This weeks 'Best Ball Skills' certificate went to Arlen, the 'Best Team Player'
                certificate was taken by Alex C. Our best all rounder trophy went to Troy.

                Last week the Knights were running low on players but never the less running hot on
                play. Starting the deluge was young Hugh Collin with a decisive goal setting a flood
                from Rafael, Ben, Henry, William. Which basically means everyone scored.&nbsp;
                <img class="top noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_thumbs_up.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                Highlights were young David Ben Beckham's defense, David Rafael Beckham's striking
                and an all round immaculate effort of tackling, driving the ball forward, and holding
                position by the entire David North Ryde Beckham squad.
                <br/><br/>
                Final score 7 to 2.
                <br/><br/>
                Well done to other squad for never giving up and good sportsman ship all round.
                Here's to an equally good game this week effort wise and with a fuller squad who
                knows what will happen.
                <br/><br/>
                Good luck North Ryde!

                Another cracker of a game, the boys certainly showing confidence slotting 4 goals in
                to the net and showing great signs in defence with no goals conceded.
                <br/><br/>
                First half started off a little slow but when Jarrod opened up the goal count with
                some more really good running with the ball put the boys on the front foot. Good work
                from all round team work with a happy Blake opening up his goal account with a great
                bustling run up the middle to finish with the ball in the back of the net.
                <br/><br/>
                You can see from the side line the boys really understand the attack and defence set
                up of a game with the boys falling back behind the ball when losing possession which
                makes it hard on the attacking sides to penetrate the goal and how that defence turns
                quickly into attack.
                <br/><br/>
                As the boys gain more game fitness the confidence grows with Alex gaining more touches
                of the ball and the Luke boys attacking the ball putting pressure back on the opposition,
                also big hit ups from hard man Jay and Kaiden gaining field position with the long kicks
                up field.
                <br/><br/>
                A really great effort from all the lads, with Luke A taking the man of the match due
                to his defence and skill on the ball.
                <br/><br/>
                Well done!&nbsp;

                Holy Cross College, cut grass, dry grounds, no rain - things were looking up! And
                with the improved conditions came an improved start to the Div 1's match against
                their fellow rivals from Glenhaven.
                <br/><br/>
                <img class="imgtopleft noborder" src="images/photos/u9/20090627_u9_div1_2.jpg">
                They launched into attack with vigour from the word go, and strung together a sequence
                of passes that we hadn't seen for a while. Adam to Jett, Jett to David, David up the
                line and a lofty cross to the ubiquitous Eli, who intercepted the pass and sunk it
                into the back of the nets.
                <br/><br/>
                A few moments later and another terrific series of quick and precise passes saw David
                with the ball at his feet with just the one defender to beat, who, once done, powered
                the ball with his right boot into the top-left of the Glenhaven nets with some amount
                of disdain.
                <br/><br/>
                With the team in this kind of dominating form in the initial passages of play it
                seemed we were going to be in for a cracker of a match. But the flurry of efficiency
                <img class="imgright noborder" src="images/photos/u9/20090627_u9_div1_3.jpg">
                and teamwork seemed to subside as quickly as it had begun, and the discipline was
                replaced by a certain degree of complacency and a rather haphazard execution of the
                intended game plan.
                <br/><br/>
                The play became a bit sluggish, and was not helped by the magnetic qualities of the
                far sideline, which, for a space of about five minutes, seemed to draw the ball back
                over the line a split-second after it had been thrown in&nbsp;
                <img class="top noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_frowning.gif">

                Glenhaven, for their part, and possibly encouraged by the hole or two that was
                appearing in the North Ryde game, made just two breaks to goal in the entire first
                half but were able to convert their opportunities on both occasions, rather soft goals
                at that, and bring the scores level to two apiece at the break.
                <br/><br/>
                The second half carried on where the first had left off, and the ball kept flying
                from one half to the other in tennis-like fashion as only a linesman, I now realise,
                can appreciate&nbsp;
                <img class="top noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_winking.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                Shannon was working hard to ferret the ball from the opposition and make something
                happen, and Tom Maclean was very quick to shut down any advances made by the Glenhaven
                <img class="imgright noborder" src="images/photos/u9/20090627_u9_div1_5.jpg">
                forwards. There was a mild skirmish in the Glenhaven goal mouth which, but for the
                vast quantity of bodies between the ball and the goal line, would have given North
                Ryde the winning goal they were so desperately seeking. In this pinball frenzy,
                Anthony managed to get a foot on the ball which all but went in, hitting the left post
                before the keeper threw his body on the ball and effectively extinguished the flame.
                <br/><br/>
                Harrison kept goal in the second half and his heavy right boot ensured the ball would
                land in the other half with each clearance kick. Jack and Patrick played their usual
                and reliable game in the fashion of: clean tackle, steal ball, turn around, change
                the course of play. Jett had an awesome game, using his strength and speed to rip the
                ball off the opposition and blast it pretty much wherever he wanted it to go. Charlie,
                David, Adam, Eli and Shannon worked the midfield with determination and great foot
                skills to move the ball within striking distance and try and clench that elusive
                winning goal. The brave young Div 1's kept plugging away, and some of the magic that
                we saw at the start of the match returned to their feet in the dying moments of the
                game.
                <br/><br/>
                <img class="imgtopleft noborder" src="images/photos/u9/20090627_u9_div1_6.jpg">
                With a little over one minute of play to go, Tom Maclean ran with the ball at
                scintillating pace down the right wing and put a handy cross in that clattered into
                the defenders and earned North Ryde a corner kick. The corner play was powerful, and
                was only halted by the hand of an unfortunate defender inside the Glenhaven box.
                <br/><br/>
                Cometh the hour, cometh the man. With the seconds ticking away, Tom blasted the
                penalty kick past the keeper's outstretched hand into the bottom-right corner of
                the Glenhaven nets to gift North Ryde a 3 - 2 win. Well done Tom&nbsp;

                Not the prettiest game by any stretch, and certainly well behind the potential of
                this young Div 1 team, but a building block all the same with a few do's and don'ts
                for the skills they will inevitably employ as move forward.

                With a blue sky and the sun shining it was a perfect day for a game of soccer!
                <br/><br/>
                Holy Cross started strongly but our defensive pairing of <span class="bold">Peter</span>
                and <span class="bold">Andrhea</span> performed really well.
                <span class="bold">Oscar</span> tried really hard to score a goal for the team.
                <img class="imgleft noborder" src="images/photos/u9/20090627_u9_div4_2.jpg">
                However, we did not have any luck. <span class="bold">Matthew</span> also produced
                some big kicks to get the ball out of the danger area. At half time we were down
                3 - 0.
                <br/><br/>
                <span class="bold">Thomas S</span> made many saves with his wonderful slides.
                <span class="bold">Rhea</span> also had a good chance to score. Besides that, we
                could not play without little <span class="bold">Andrhea</span> and her terrific
                defence against the big players. Well done Andrhea, you deserved your Player of
                the Week award.
                <br/><br/>
                Amazingly, <span class="bold">Peter</span> tricked a couple of players with his
                quick feet and some good passing to his team mates. This is what Team Sport is all
                about.
                <br/><br/>
                Our goalies, <span class="bold">Hamish</span> and <span class="bold">Liam</span>,
                had their work cut out with all the opposition attacks. Surprisingly,
                <span class="bold">Ryan</span> played with some aggressive moves to prevent any
                further damage to the scoreline.
                <br/><br/>
                <span class="bold">Satya</span> and <span class="bold">Ryan</span> looked for free
                space and attempted to control the game. Our new team member,
                <span class="bold">Anaya</span>, also contributed with her kicking game. Well done

                saved many certain goals in the first half. Our coach (my Dad) said we were doing

                No early goals today with our new attitude, commitment and defensive line up with
                Regan C at sweeper, Matthew U at stopper, Victor T at right back and William G at
                left back tackling and challenging strongly for every ball.
                <br/><br/>
                Regan C at sweeper once again performed his role superbly and has fitted into this
                position extremely well. William G has relished his opportunities out of goal and
                seemed to pop up all over the field wherever needed using his pace and size to great
                advantage as at least 1 Glenhaven player who was on the receiving end of a good

                Matthew U fitted in to the role of stopper and was rock solid and continues to grow
                in confidence each week, he was ably supported by Victor T who had one of his
                strongest games so far. The efforts of the backs was rounded off by a solid
                goalkeeping display by Tyler R who read the game well and attacked the ball when
                appropriate, well done Tyler.

                The team responded courageously to this setback and set about putting things right
                with a great come-from-behind win.
                <br/><br/>
                Liam T, Jordan C and Sam B controlled the midfield and continually worried the
                Glenhaven defence whenever they had the ball at their feet as well as challenging
                strongly and more often than not winning possession from Glenhaven Stephen B-H has
                responded well to his shift to left half and his increased involvement in the game
                in this position saw him score a double in this game. Liam T rather fittingly for
                his strong efforts was also rewarded with a well taken goal.
                <br/><br/>
                Tim B and Lewis B as strikers continually worried the Glenhaven defence and Lewis B
                and despite not  scoring themselves contributed in the build up to the goals scored.
                Well done to everyone you should be as proud of yourselves as are your coach, manager,
                parents and club President Mark Simpson. Keep up the great work at training and on
                the field and more wins will come your way for sure.

                The sun was finally shining but the ground resembled something that had been left
                over after a good old mud wrestle! The boys were depleted today from their injury
                prone week before but still managed to muster up a few reserves on the bench. Nth
                didn't start well though as they lost the toss. Would this be an omen for things to
                come? The stoush against WPH is always an interesting one but the boys seemed friendly
                enough before the game. Pommie ran on with his boxing gloves but the ref asked him to
                remove them.&nbsp;
                <img class="top noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_smiling.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                The passing in the first five minutes from Nth Ryde was well controlled. WPH finally
                got a touch on the ball 5 minutes in and sent a high ball through to Higgo; he was
                put under pressure by the WPH striker steaming through on him. Mark H supported Higgo
                well and the pair diffused the situation well. Mark H then sent the ball onto Firgs;
                the passing was spectacular as it went from Nth Ryde player to Nth Ryde player in a
                well controlled display of football. After the movement through 7 sets of feet Dutchie
                had the final say with a shot on goal that unfortunately went wide. Nth seemed to be
                playing well especially in the left wing, Macca was ably assisting in defence.
                <br/><br/>
                <img class="imgtopleft noborder" src="images/objects/yellow_card.jpg">
                Dutchie received our first yellow card of many for the afternoon as he cheekily walked
                past a WPH player taking a free kick. The ball hit the back of his legs and Dutchie
                innocently tried to argue his way out of the yellow with a 'what did I do ref' comment!
                From the ensuing free kick to WPH they had control of the play & through some poor Nth
                Ryde defence had a shot on goal. As always Agro was in the right position and shut the
                attack down quickly. Nth then had some clever play with Firgs up the sideline which saw
                the WPH players arguing with the ref that the ball had gone out. The Nth Ryde players
                continued to play to the whistle and cleverly Firgs kicked the ball to deflect off a
                WPH player to the sideline. This gave Nth an advantage of about 15 metres all because
                they played to the whistle! Nth gained the advantage and it lead to a half attempt on
                goal by Dutchie. (You'll see his name pop up quite a bit in this report today as he
                seemed to be everywhere). Nth then received a free kick and Dutchie stepped up to take
                it. He hit the ball into the box and Macca was waiting. He hit an awesome header and
                the keeper just got to it to pull off a great save. Nth were having their chances but
                just not able to convert. Ando then received a free kick and he wasn't too far it. It
                was a great opportunity to score. Now I know Ando is something like 10 foot tall (at
                least to me he seems that tall!), but Ando, really, did you need to hit the ball that
                hard and high that it found its way into the top of the tallest gum trees in the
                district? The goalie only stood knee high to a grasshopper!  Nth then had some more
                of the play and continued to offer shots to the WPH very tall keeper! Nth were finding
                the open spaces well and applying some great pressure to WPH but just couldn't convert
                their chances.
                <br/><br/>
                Subs were called for as the boys were getting tired. The subbing seemed to rattle Nth
                a little and they found themselves under some pressure from WPH. Agro again pulled off
                two great saves to keep Nth at 0-0. It would have been a shame to have a goal conceded
                at this point as Nth definitely had the run of play.WPH continued to apply some pressure
                and had two corners in succession. Agro was taken off the ball by a WPH striker and let
                the ref know his thoughts on the matter! Nth were back on the offensive & Higgo put a
                great ball through to Pommie who had an excellent opportunity to score the first goal
                for Nth, somehow he managed to fire the ball right at the keeper. Matt S then had a
                little stoush with his opposing number but neither player received a card for their
                efforts. The half ended at 0-0 but Nth should have been at least one or two goals up.
                Composure and patience was called for by Darren at half time.
                <br/><br/>
                The second half started like this:
                <br/><br/>
                <img class="imgtopright noborder" src="images/objects/ball_in_net.jpg">
                Kick off, ball to Dutchie, Dutchie passed to Steve and Steve laid a great ball back
                to Dutchie who found himself in open territory one-on-one with the keeper. He beat the
                keeper and sent the first goal into the net! What a goal and it came from some clever
                passing which Nth had continued to do all day, the reward had finally come.
                <br/><br/>
                Now the events turn weirder. Nth Ryde received a penalty from some pushing by WPH in
                the box. It was a big call and Dutchie again stepped up to the mark. Now usually Dutchie
                would chew up opportunities like this but Ando had got in his ear about how to kick and
                as Dutchie moved in to strike the ball he got too much of it and the ball hit the cross
                bar. He could have been a complete hero within 10 minutes of the half starting but
                missed his opportunity. The ball rebounded into the field of play and Nth had lost
                their advantage momentarily. Macca then received a free kick for a push in the back,
                it didn't amount to much and the play continued. Matt S then began his chatter again
                with his opposing number and received a yellow card for it. It was a shame as Nth was
                <img class="imgleft noborder" src="images/objects/red_card.jpg">
                on the offensive at the time. Steve P was having an excellent game up front until an
                injury saw him sidelined for the day. Add that one to the growing injury list and next
                week could see Nth in trouble. Brownie then had a run with the ball and somehow that
                sniper popped up again to bring him down like a sack of potatoes. Did Ado have something
                to do with it? I wonder...! In the blink of an eye the play turned nasty and a WPH player
                decided to have a go at Macca. Macca, not one to ever back down in a situation had his
                say back to his opposing number. The ref then saw something from Macca that he didn't
                like - let's just say that knees and groins don't always go together, and Macca received
                a red card for his efforts.
                <br/><br/>
                Now sitting on the sideline one would have thought that both players would have been
                sent off, as it was a 50/50 stoush but the ref decided that the WPH player 'was so close
                to a red' but only received a yellow. Now we were down to 10 men and with a lead of only
                1-0, had the spectators worried about the outcome. Well, it didn't seem to bother Nth at
                all as they lifted and even played better than what they had been. They had more
                opportunities to score but couldn't convert. Brownie then received a yellow card for a
                bad tackle which he told me after the game was 'perfectly legal'. Brownie, it was one of
                the worse tackles I have seen in a long time and your studs were up! Nth then had a few
                corners that they just couldn't convert off and some more WPH chatter saw Col very upset.
                He retaliated with some verbal banter and received a yellow card for his efforts. Darren
                was quick to sub him as he seemed to be rattled by the moment. Pierre then came into the
                running for the goal of the season. He hit a ball from about 20 metres out; he had two
                other attacking options but decided to go himself. Now, we know the keeper was not the
                tallest (hey Ando) so Pierre decided to back himself and go for goal. He hit it and over
                the keepers head it went and into the back of the net. The sideline went crazy as it was
                just desserts for having the WPH players gesture the sideline when Macca was sent off.
                2-0 Nth Ryde, Nth then had to defend but did it well. They were a man down but didn't
                play that way. Dutchie had a blinder and was well backed up by all of his team. With
                minutes to go, Darren began the substitutes. Karim only saw about 10 seconds of play in
                the second half until the full time whistle was blown. What a great team effort with some
                brilliant individual opportunities, 2-0 Nth Ryde.&nbsp;
