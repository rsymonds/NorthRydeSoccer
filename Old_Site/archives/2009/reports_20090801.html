                This was a fast paced gamed with so much running and crashing into each other. Well
                done to the Purple team for keeping their energy levels high to keep pace. Jayden,
                Cameron, Will, Lukah, Jasmine and Lucas are now not only a great team, but also
                great mates.&nbsp;

                <br/><br/>
                Whilst this game may not have resulted in a goal, they showed so much improvement
                today, every player was more involved in the game, running to goal side to defend
                the ball and chasing after it to attack. A cheer went out when a player shoulder
                charged the Ravens to defend the goal - a brilliant move!
                <br/><br/>
                Coach Marc says today "There was great defence, the whole team was running. They
                are playing much better."
                <br/><br/>

                Today was a day that turned most of the predictable results in the U9 Div 1 league
                on their head, and North Ryde was no exception. Top-ranked Normanhurst Eagles were
                toppled by 5th-placed Saints United and 2nd-placed West Pennant Hills were held to
                a draw by their 4th-placed Kenthurst rivals. North Ryde, for their part, were held
                to a 3-all draw against 8th-placed West Ryde Rovers, a team they had dominated by
                8 goals to nil on their previous encounter. There's no such thing as a sure bet&nbsp;
                <img class="top noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_winking.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                It must be said though, that West Ryde Rovers made their only 3 attempts on goal
                count, and full marks to their goal keeper who had a busy day between the posts
                fending off a barrage of at least 8 to 10 good shots on goal to deny North Ryde
                the win.
                <br/><br/>
                <img class="noborder imgtopleft" src="images/photos/u9/20090801_u9_div1_2.jpg">
                North Ryde came out at the start of the game with guns blazing as has been their
                custom over the past few matches, and scored their first two goals quickly and with
                relative ease. It was a short and powerful passage of play that can be attributed
                to a solid defence and an effective passing game in the midfield and up front. The
                first goal was a gem. The ball was worked swiftly from the backs to the forwards,
                and the shot on goal was not taken until the ball had been passed to the final player
                in the sequence, who was able to tap it into the nets unchallenged and with relative
                ease. It was made more impressive by the composure that was shown during those critical
                few seconds in the goalmouth, when an even temperament can so easily be overtaken
                by a haphazard shot at goal, and the entire movement showed how simple this game
                really is when teamwork is the underlying driver of the gameplay.
                <br/><br/>
                North Ryde lost momentum after their initial exchanges though, and Rovers hit
                back quite quickly with 2 goals in the first half to take the score to 3 - 2 in
                North Ryde's favour at the break. The second half was a rather poor cousin to the
                first half from a North Ryde perspective, and the hunger for a win seemed to all
                but evaporate when teamwork and connecting passes were replaced with sporadic
                attempts on the Rover's goal. Some of the wind was taken out of their sails by the
                Rover's keeper who was able to clutch onto the ball in magnetic fashion, and North
                Ryde were not able to reply to the one further goal scored by Rovers that ended
                the game in a 3 - 3 draw.
                <br/><br/>
                It wasn't North Ryde's best game this season, and they were perhaps unlucky not
                to manage a win today, but they continue to try hard all the same and now look
                forward to the round robin play-off after finishing 3rd in the league.
                <br/><br/>
                Well done North Ryde!&nbsp;

                Arriving at James Henty this morning for our 8.15am start we were greeted with a
                sunny but crisp winter morning and even a touch of frost on the ground. It was
                chilly and chilling knowing we were up against the 3rd-placed West Pennant Hills.
                <br/><br/>
                <img class="noborder imgtopleft" src="images/photos/u9/20090801_u9_div4_2.jpg">
                Our Round 1 result was a 6-0 loss and this week we were without our striker Rhea
                and our other striker, Oscar, turned his hand to goal-keeping.
                <br/><br/>
                What happened in the next 20 minutes was arguably one of our best-ever halves. All
                players were heavily involved in moving the ball around and going forward.
                <br/><br/>
                West Pennant Hills had a couple of very good goal shooters and the goal they scored
                just before half-time would make any senior or junior coach very happy.
                <br/><br/>
                <img class="noborder imgtopright" src="images/photos/u9/20090801_u9_div4_3.jpg">
                After the break our marking dropped off a little and they scored their second goal.
                However we were still playing well enough to match their skills and some great goal
                threading by Hamish saw the ball past 2 defenders and the imposing goal keeper.&nbsp;
                <img class="top noborder" src="images/objects/smiley_thumbs_up.gif">
                <br/><br/>
                The final result was 4 - 1 to Pennant Hills however all our players played
                exceptionally well. There were many stand-outs and it was a great team effort with
                everyone being heavily involved in kicking, tackling and running.
                <br/><br/>
                Well done everyone and a special mention to Hamish and Andhrea who received the
                awards this week.
                <br/><br/>
                That game was the last official game and on behalf of all the parents and children
                we want to say a special thankyou to our 2 coaches Scott and Allan, our goal-keeping
                coach Stuart, and Mandy for being our team manager.&nbsp;
