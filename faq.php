									                  or the people that are present in the photograph.
									                  <br/><br/>
									                  Note that it is not the responsibility of the website administration to
									                  obtain permission from the respective parties to publish a photo on the
									                  web. It is assumed that the appropriate consent has already been secured
									                  by the time the photo is sent to the website administration for publishing.

									                  <br/>
									                  2. The number of photos published is proportional to the amount of report text
									                  content
									                  <br/>
									                  3. The content of the report may be edited for obvious corrections, privacy
