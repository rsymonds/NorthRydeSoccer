</br> </br>
Payment is to take place when you register.

You have two choices on-line. You can pay by credit card or your can pay by EFT to the North Ryde Soccer Club.

If you are paying by EFT it is important that you put a reference with your payment. Name and Age Group is ideal. 

(eg Ryan Giggs U16).

Registration Process - New Players (face to face or online)

If you are brand new to North Ryde or if you simply must register in the old way, then come along on Sunday 9th

February from 1pm to 4pm at Nth Ryde RSL Youth Club. Bring your Cash or Cheque and Birth Certificate.

A lot of new players like to go along to the Registration Day as they lots of questions to ask. We will have people on 

hand to answer those questions. We also refer to the Playing at NRSC in 2014 Document.

You can also choose to pay online, you can pay by credit card or you can do an EFT to our club bank account.

All new players will need to provide the club with a Photo. This can be done by our team at Registration Day or you 

can supply a photo on-line. Existing players may also need to provide an updated photo. The online process will 

prompt you if this is required.
